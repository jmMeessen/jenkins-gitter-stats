22/07/2022, 17:56:19 - Dheeraj: I spent the last 20 mins or so trying to find a way to write tests for the scheduled jobs until I saw a comment by someone on StackOverflow saying "This seems like a silly test. The cron expression is declarative and you should trust it". What do you think?
25/07/2022, 08:57:09 - @better_sleeping:converser.eu joined the room
25/07/2022, 08:57:12 - @better_sleeping:converser.eu left the room
25/07/2022, 10:56:31 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it's true. The cron expression doesn't need to be tested.
25/07/2022, 10:57:32 - Dheeraj: okay
25/07/2022, 12:34:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): have you tested what you have done @dheeraj?
25/07/2022, 14:19:11 - Dheeraj: I tested by putting a print statement inside the readUpdateCenter() method which prints the current time, and set the cron expression to run every 2 mins (0 */2 * * * *). And it did print every 2 mins, but as you pointed out I also need to include the "saving into DB" task while Scheduling.

So, now my latest commit schedules both of the tasks. I tested it by putting a print statement in both the methods (readUpdateCenter and saveOrUpdate) and I could see the expected output in my console.

Not sure if that correctly addresses your question.
25/07/2022, 15:12:39 - jleon33 (jleon33): 23 responses so far on the survey. Shall we send out one final reminder and thank you to those who took it already?
25/07/2022, 17:18:01 - Dheeraj: nope, something is fishy. I'm doing something wrong. I'm trying to debug now
25/07/2022, 17:33:03 - Dheeraj: Since we did receive an increased number of responses as compared to the last time you shared the numbers here, I agree with your suggestion to send a final reminder like "hey we're still accepting responses for the next 1-2 weeks, and then we'll be closing"...but I'll defer to others' opinion on this. We can discuss this tomorrow
25/07/2022, 18:18:31 - Dheeraj: I found nothing weird, works for me locally.
When I changed the cron to `0 */2 * * * *`, I can see that in every 2 mins, `readUpdateCenter` is called once and `saveOrUpdate` is called 1800+ times, as expected.
26/07/2022, 15:59:59 - jleon33 (jleon33): will be a few minutes before im on the call
26/07/2022, 16:02:50 - Dheeraj: no worries, take your time
29/07/2022, 09:23:20 - Dheeraj: @jleon33, can you please attach the July 26 recording to our notes?
29/07/2022, 12:58:54 - jleon33 (jleon33): will do


29/07/2022, 14:40:26 - jleon33 (jleon33): been added @dheerajodha 
29/07/2022, 18:15:25 - Dheeraj: Thank you Jake ^_^
02/08/2022, 10:40:24 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha is there any issues ongoing? 
02/08/2022, 10:55:57 - Dheeraj: @alecharp 
I was able to figure out a logic to know when was the last time the scheduled method was executed, and based on that I've used a dummy ZonedDateTime value (in place of generation time of update center) and accordingly executed the updateDatabase() method only if the generation-time of UC is in future.
02/08/2022, 11:00:27 - Dheeraj: And for the env variable issue that you created yesterday, I thought to give it a try. The schedule works every minute if I run the Spring project by manually exporting the cron expression variable. But when I run the project by docker, I place that same cron-expression variable in .env file, I do not see expected results so I need to explore more on this issue.
02/08/2022, 12:02:39 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Great. Thanks for the update
02/08/2022, 20:09:46 - Dheeraj: @jleon33 when you're back, can you please add today's (Aug 02) recording to the meeting notes?
03/08/2022, 10:24:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'll do that
03/08/2022, 10:26:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): but I cannot change the permission to let everyone access it.
03/08/2022, 13:45:11 - Dheeraj: @alecharp Sorry but I just realized there's one more holiday that I forgot to mention on our yesterday's call. It's a company-wide recharge day on August 12.
03/08/2022, 17:33:30 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): noted. no problem
04/08/2022, 13:25:55 - Dheeraj: @alecharp, I'm almost done reviewing your Probe Engine PR (currently understanding the test file). I was side by side reading the documentation of the GitHub class to understand what some of the methods are really doing. Will submit the review soon, thanks!
04/08/2022, 14:46:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): great
04/08/2022, 14:47:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): btw, the rate limit issue is bad. I couldn't get to have two probes using the GitHub API  without having API rate limitation. 
04/08/2022, 14:55:54 - Dheeraj: I've submitted my review.
04/08/2022, 14:57:58 - Dheeraj: Okay, noted. I see in the issue you've created that JGit is something I can explore.
04/08/2022, 15:58:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): answered
04/08/2022, 15:59:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I would probably prefer that you look into https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/23
05/08/2022, 12:34:42 - Dheeraj: ok sure, I'm currently going to spend short time on using the env variable to configure scheduling, and then quickly come back to this
05/08/2022, 12:45:41 - Dheeraj: @alecharp I'm trying to shift the cron expression inside the .env file (with content: `SC=0 */1 * * * *`) and have replaced the "cronexpression" field's value in application.properties to use the ${SC}.

When I try to run the application manually using "mvn spring-boot:run" everything works well (when I exported the SC value before it). But when I try to run the application using the `docker compose down`, `docker compose up --build` command I see the following error:


`plugin-health-scoring-db-1   | 2022-08-05 10:40:06.686 UTC [79] ERROR:  constraint "uk_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po" of relation "plugins" does not exist`
`plugin-health-scoring-db-1   | 2022-08-05 10:40:06.686 UTC [79] STATEMENT:  alter table plugins drop constraint UK_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po`
05/08/2022, 12:49:08 - Dheeraj: When I test my connection to the DB from my IDE, it shows a successful connection.
05/08/2022, 12:54:24 - Dheeraj: Hmm, interesting. So, when I just checkout to main branch, even then I see the same error while running `docker compose up`
05/08/2022, 13:00:25 - Dheeraj: I also tried to generate the latest jar by running: `mvn package -DskipTests` but still the same error.

oops, this error was present even during my midterm presentation (https://youtu.be/loLSNdCv6K4?t=1294) I guess it can be ignored...
05/08/2022, 13:06:11 - Dheeraj: Message deleted
05/08/2022, 14:38:48 - Dheeraj: opened a PR, a test indicates that the env var is not getting read.
on it.
07/08/2022, 06:52:30 - Dheeraj: Message deleted
07/08/2022, 07:00:26 - Dheeraj: FYI: https://community.jenkins.io/t/abandonment-risk-assessment-for-embedded-open-source-components/3177
07/08/2022, 16:20:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): The error is not about misconnection but because the code is trying to save in the DB  plugin which is already in the DB
08/08/2022, 08:59:15 - Dheeraj: Okay. Thanks for letting me know
08/08/2022, 09:25:03 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): read the error message, it should be putting you in the correct direction. Btw, this shouldn't happen. so I hope you have investigated the root cause of the issue
08/08/2022, 12:30:31 - Dheeraj: I get the same error even when the database is initially empty, so I' confused if the code is trying to save a plugin in DB which already exists there beforehand.

The message tells me that this command is being executed: "alter table plugins drop constraint UK_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po"
Result of which is: "constraint "uk_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po" of relation "plugins" does not exist".

I removed the "unique = true" from the `name` field in `Plugin` but still see that error.

I searched what this "uk_..." is and when I describe my "plugins" table by using "\d plugins" I see there's an index available:
`"uk_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (name)`
08/08/2022, 12:33:53 - Dheeraj: I don't know why I'm seeing a unique constraint automatically create on the `name` field, maybe because of the definition we have in our `equals()` and/or `hashcode()` method.
08/08/2022, 12:38:09 - Dheeraj: What I don't understand is why would it complain when we try to add an already-existing plugin object. Because as per the current implementation of our `saveOrUpdate` method, we check if there's any object in the database with the same name as the current plugin object.

If yes, then we just update its field with setters and use `map(pluginRepository::save)` to UPDATE the object.

If not, then we simply use `pluginRepository.save(plugin)` to save the object.
08/08/2022, 12:57:42 - jleon33 (jleon33): access has been updated. sorry for the delay!
08/08/2022, 16:31:08 - Dheeraj: @alecharp Today afternoon I spent some time investigating the constraint-related error as discussed above, then I moved to the enabling batch updates task.
After reading a tutorial and watching a video I learned that it can be enabled by adding 2 lines in application.properties file (`batch_size` and `order_updates`).
08/08/2022, 18:01:05 - Dheeraj: Right now I'm testing it
08/08/2022, 18:37:18 - Dheeraj: The way I'm currently trying to see whether the updates are being done in batches is by adding this line: `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.generate_statistics=true` in application.properties file, and wrote a temporary test that adds 50 plugin objects in DB then fetches them (with `findAll()`) and adds them again with `saveAll()` method. This generated some stats which mention the number of batches and time taken by their execution.

I'm curious about how did you test it? I'm guessing you didn't just add 2 lines and got done. Did you use "PreparedStatement Batch Updates" instead?
09/08/2022, 14:23:24 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you don't need PreparedStatement
09/08/2022, 14:25:20 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): but currently we save one plugin at a time
09/08/2022, 15:32:05 - Dheeraj: okay :thumbsup:
09/08/2022, 15:58:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): look at the method "saveAll" in the repository parent interface
15/08/2022, 15:12:02 - jleon33 (jleon33): Happy independence day Dheeraj and Aditya! 
15/08/2022, 15:25:03 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much Jake!!  \(^_^)/
15/08/2022, 16:09:16 - jleon33 (jleon33): Question, I can make a copy of the survey to keep the results separate from maintainers, but do we want to share a  survey out to end users of Jenkins. Might be good ammunition to have and compare the priorities/perceptions of users vs maintainers
15/08/2022, 16:20:56 - Dheeraj: Sounds good to me. I think there's no harm in sending a separate survey to users as well
15/08/2022, 18:08:51 - jleon33 (jleon33): here is a copy of the survey, tweaked marginally to address users instead of maintainers. https://forms.gle/NN53DJeDkzWD2LXp7
15/08/2022, 18:09:00 - jleon33 (jleon33): feel free to share out to jenkins users you know 
16/08/2022, 02:32:19 - Dheeraj: thanks, how are we going to share this with Jenkins users, other than 1:1 communication?
would the jenkins-users mailing list be a good option? If I checked correctly, it has 20k people subscribed to it.
16/08/2022, 13:54:24 - jleon33 (jleon33): I think that would be our best option. Not sure if there are some rules or what have you around sending things out to that list? I will check with JMM 
16/08/2022, 14:43:47 - Dheeraj: @alecharp while running the main branch locally, do you see the results of the scm validation probe in the `details` Map of each plugin?
19/08/2022, 11:00:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier):  hello @dheerajodha. How things are going?
19/08/2022, 13:39:21 - Dheeraj: Hello Adrien, thank you for checking in! I was going to share the updates with you but then it slipped from my mind sorry
So, just for exploring/testing, I created a new project on IntelliJ where I write the JGit probes to confirm if the logic works or not. I found it faster to run this project instead of running our main project every 30 seconds.

So, I was able to fetch the last commit date of the repo using its scm link. It would not take much time to add this logic as a new probe to our project.
19/08/2022, 13:40:53 - Dheeraj: While I was trying to do that by first pulling the content of the latest PR merged, and then running the project I noticed that the probe engine throws an exception on a specific plugin's scm. That plugin is "google-deployment-manager" and it has a weird SCM link: "https://github.com/jenkinsci/${project.gitProjectId}"
19/08/2022, 14:44:23 - Dheeraj: I also noticed that inside the `saveOrUpdate` method, I'm not updating the `details` Map of each plugin. Due to this, none of the new results of our probe engine are getting stored in the DB.

And, if I'm not wrong, there isn't any plugin that is hitting the `ProbeResult.success` criteria of the `SCMLinkValidationProbe`. So, none of the plugin's scm is returning a `statusCode` of 200.
19/08/2022, 14:52:57 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I see that I didn't include the new GITHUB_OAUTH env var requirement in the `README.md` file
19/08/2022, 14:53:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): see https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps
19/08/2022, 14:53:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/7279a05c6b283062ab59df93d9cf154e57f35532/src/main/resources/application.yaml#L14
19/08/2022, 15:03:16 - Dheeraj: Thanks for the reminder, works now. I'll update the readme
22/08/2022, 08:47:39 - Dheeraj: [Update]: I ran the project with the new probe which adds the last commit date of each plugin into the DB. I'm doing that by cloning each plugin repo, which soon produced the problem of low space in my laptop so I'll switch to my personal laptop (which is crashed for more than a week now, as I installed ubuntu 20.04) from tomorrow as it won't have any space issue.

Then I tried to delete the plugin repo right after probe analysis of each plugin ends, which doesn't give any space issues. So, now I see the object of this probe in the DB alongside "scm" and "deprecations" probes. I'll push a PR within 6hrs as I need to try to clean the code first.
22/08/2022, 14:23:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): once the last commit is found, you can delete the clone. well, you need to cleanup
22/08/2022, 15:02:33 - Dheeraj: yes, I will clean the code and then open a PR.
23/08/2022, 14:42:11 - jleon33 (jleon33): howdy @dheerajodha - how goes it? Would you like to meet up today? or just chat async? 
23/08/2022, 15:22:06 - jleon33 (jleon33): Is our architecture diagram still up to date? I would think so, I just want to make sure. I plan on showing it in the DevOps World presentation
23/08/2022, 15:29:08 - Dheeraj: heyyy Jake, going greaaat! I wrote my first probe and opened a PR so pretty happy.
23/08/2022, 15:30:57 - Dheeraj: oh right, Adrien is out of office, I forgot.
so no, there's no need for a meeting from my side. I have some observations regarding the code which now I'll just share here instead
23/08/2022, 15:42:02 - Dheeraj: its complete-ish
I need to remove the tilted squares near the "Postgres Database" which will further simplify the diagram. As suggested by Adrien previously while we were discussing this, I'd re-make this diagram using GitHub's Mermaid so that the interested people from your DevOps World presentation can see this diagram in our repo as well. I think I'll be able to do this before your talk
23/08/2022, 15:42:22 - jleon33 (jleon33): Please remind me, do we have an idea of how the math will work for calculating the scores? or did we hold off on that as its a bit down the line and probably out of scope?
23/08/2022, 15:43:03 - jleon33 (jleon33): Ok, let me know. Not a huge rush. I think the final deadline for the presentations is aug 31. 
23/08/2022, 15:45:07 - Dheeraj: oo okay, thanks for letting me know. will get it done before aug 31 for sure 👌 
23/08/2022, 15:57:45 - Dheeraj: We didn't have any discussion on this in Phase 1 and not in this phase as well because it felt its a bit down the line. But the math written in my proposal doc "just works", it will give you the final scores out of 100, though it can be improved and updated.

I'll add it as a discussion topic for our next meeting (aug 30) where all of us would be there.
23/08/2022, 16:00:11 - Dheeraj: ^ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTbcWh5C1KrCgEzgqeVEPyfr1H5fH5eTj8KpbWrWsSY/edit#bookmark=id.j1mz28d6k5s1
23/08/2022, 16:32:57 - jleon33 (jleon33): thank you sir!
23/08/2022, 16:41:01 - Dheeraj: @alecharp, regarding what we discussed in our last meeting, I'm referring to the timestamp 27:27 in the recording (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DD2jxYv8UCblpb-LOY-qDhoeLHCzbjSG/view). You said that regarding my new probe file, when I'm querying the plugin's `details` Map to get the value of the "previously executed" probe (which is SCMLinkValidationProbe), I won't be able to access this value since this has not been added to the database yet. That's true, but I noticed that for every probe, when it is done executing on a given plugin, we are adding its `ProbeResult`into the plugin's `details`map. And the `probeResult`of this probe would be available for the next probe to do some checks with. So, with this approach which I'm using currently, things are working fine.
23/08/2022, 16:48:19 - Dheeraj: But while I was writing this message, I realized what you also said when you realized that I'm querying a plugin's `details` map to get the `ProbeResult`of the previously executed probe. I see, you meant that this is not the way we'd like to do things. We'd like to instead pass context down from one related probe to another, so the probes won't need to check the values from the `details` map.

If I'm visualizing it correctly, this is similar to a funnel that has another funnel below it, then there's another funnel below it, almost like a continuous pathway between all of them which helps in passing relevant information from one probe to another.

And this is what your latest PR (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/32) aims to do.

Did I get this right?
23/08/2022, 18:00:55 - Dheeraj: Added a comment (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/32/files#r952818504) on your PR, if you'd like to continue this conversation there
26/08/2022, 19:53:39 - jleon33 (jleon33): can y'all give me a short bio about yourself for my devops world presentation? @alecharp @ADI10HERO @dheerajodha 
29/08/2022, 14:41:26 - jleon33 (jleon33): Will not be at tomorrows call as I have a conflict 😟 
29/08/2022, 20:30:26 - Dheeraj: Sorry for the late reply. Suddenly I don't know how to write a bio. I couldn't think of anything else to add (suggestions are welcome!)...

If there's some space to share links to contact the person, then if you like, you can also share my LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dheeraj-sj/) and/or GitHub (https://github.com/dheerajodha). Thank you, Jake
29/08/2022, 20:31:25 - Dheeraj: No problem, we'll discuss the point you've raised previously.
29/08/2022, 21:15:05 - jleon33 (jleon33): thank you dheeraj!
30/08/2022, 08:44:25 - Dheeraj: Hi @alecharp 
Thank you for the help on my latest PR, I'm now going over your commits.
30/08/2022, 17:38:43 - jleon33 (jleon33): @ADI10HERO I need a a quick bio from you please. I also took @dheerajodha and @ADI10HERO linkedin pictures for my presentation
31/08/2022, 04:54:35 - kuro: Hey jleon33 (jleon33)  please take it from here https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/adi10hero
31/08/2022, 14:06:43 - jleon33 (jleon33): thanks that is great. do you prefer that picture or linked in?
31/08/2022, 20:38:50 - jleon33 (jleon33): @dheerajodha have we updated the architecture diagram yet?
01/09/2022, 13:48:36 - Dheeraj: I made some changes a few days ago in the draw.io link of the diagram but forgot to update the image in the document, I did it now. Earlier I was thinking we might not need to add more details (like which process is running on a schedule, etc etc) but maybe we should add more details in the diagram to give an accurate representation of how the project works from the start to end. I'm adding it now within a couple of hours
01/09/2022, 14:16:01 - jleon33 (jleon33): I just need it to be generally correct, and can speak to the finer details
01/09/2022, 14:17:32 - jleon33 (jleon33): I am going to use the one thats there, thank you so much :) 
01/09/2022, 14:38:07 - Dheeraj: That's what I thought too, like it has to be generally correct. But @alecharp showed some concerns about the diagram in the last meeting before you joined... (PS: I fixed a wording mistake in the diagram, just updated it)
01/09/2022, 17:46:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha I fixed the PR
01/09/2022, 17:46:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if you could test it locally that would be great.
01/09/2022, 17:47:26 - Dheeraj: Okay sure, I'll test it now
01/09/2022, 17:51:20 - Dheeraj: The test is passing now, thank you very much
01/09/2022, 18:27:25 - Dheeraj: And for example, for plugin="aws-java-sdk-logs",
"scm" probe gives SUCCESS, and "last-commit-date" probe gives SUCESS with commit date Oct 18, 2022 (can be verified form here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/aws-java-sdk-plugin/tree/master/aws-java-sdk-logs)
01/09/2022, 18:28:47 - Dheeraj: Now we are also able to get the commit date for the submodules of the repository :thumbsup: 
02/09/2022, 11:01:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha how's the test on PR-32?
02/09/2022, 11:07:57 - Dheeraj: Working on it now, I'll commit the test asap
02/09/2022, 13:09:12 - Dheeraj: I'm trying to push tests to your PR but getting a "permission denied" error. Can you check the box in the PR which says “Allow edits from maintainers.”?
02/09/2022, 15:32:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): how did you checkout my branch? 
02/09/2022, 16:15:37 - Dheeraj: Using these 2 commands:

`git pull https://github.com/alecharp/plugin-health-scoring.git feature/probe-engine-execution-context`
02/09/2022, 16:16:35 - Dheeraj: Then created a remote named "mentor" and pushed my changes with this command:
`git push mentor alecharp-feature/probe-engine-execution-context:feature/probe-engine-execution-context`
02/09/2022, 17:27:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): would have been easier to use GH CLI command
05/09/2022, 10:23:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheeraj, how is it going? 
05/09/2022, 10:28:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please see that I send you an invite to contribute to my fork, you need to accept it and then you will be able to push to it
05/09/2022, 10:51:29 - Dheeraj: yes, I have just accepted the invitation :thumbsup: 
05/09/2022, 10:56:18 - Dheeraj: I'm currently working on revamping the `UpdateCenterService` file, to take out the probe-related processing from this file and put it into its own file inside the `probes/` package.

I'll give you an update on this within 4 hours.
05/09/2022, 11:12:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please, if you have new tests for the context PR, don't move on to something less
05/09/2022, 12:09:07 - Dheeraj: I'm sorry Adrien for the miscommunication, I didn't add any more tests because those 2 unit tests answered my question. I'll think and add more tests to the context PR now :thumbsup: 
06/09/2022, 07:11:14 - Dheeraj: hi @alecharp, can you please let me know what's remaining in PR 32?
06/09/2022, 10:01:05 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): nothing I think. I'll merge it
06/09/2022, 17:53:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha I would need a like +1 on https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/37. could you review it?
06/09/2022, 18:31:20 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it cannot be merged until you review it
06/09/2022, 18:32:21 - Dheeraj: Hi Adrien
06/09/2022, 18:33:07 - Dheeraj: Sorry for the delay, I went for dinner. I'll review this now, please give me a few mins
06/09/2022, 18:35:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): sure no problem
06/09/2022, 18:36:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha please see https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite
06/09/2022, 18:37:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm going offline now. 
06/09/2022, 18:51:26 - Dheeraj: Yes, sure. I actually found that in my 2 tests I didn't mock one method due to that I'm seeing a null pointer problem.
So, I'm pushing that now, I checked it multiple times just to be sure so it took longer-than-expected time. I'm sorry to keep you waiting, please come back to this tomorrow if you like.
06/09/2022, 19:10:37 - Dheeraj: Thank you for sharing this link, I'll go through this :thumbsup:

08/09/2022, 10:24:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): any blockers?
08/09/2022, 14:41:58 - Dheeraj: I've been trying since our weekly call to work on the comments you wrote on the issue. I want to present to you something concrete and then ask for corrections from you. I know time is running out, so I'll create a PR within the next 50 mins.
08/09/2022, 15:53:10 - Dheeraj: I've put up the PR and I'm adding my comments to it, which would describe my doubts and concerns. I know it's far from the right solution, but I put it up anyway.
08/09/2022, 18:53:43 - hervelemeur joined the room
08/09/2022, 18:53:50 - hervelemeur: Hi!
08/09/2022, 18:54:30 - hervelemeur: I saw this PR and I'm wondering if these plugins scores shouldn't be affected somehow: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/backend-extension-indexer/pull/39#issuecomment-1240966890
08/09/2022, 18:55:19 - hervelemeur: better link: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/backend-extension-indexer/pull/41
09/09/2022, 12:20:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm not sure to understand the PR , however, anything could be a probe in the end and everything can impact any plugin score. However, the project is not yet in the state where we generate a score for any plugin.
09/09/2022, 13:25:13 - Dheeraj: I discussed this with Mark during the Docs Office hours today, as per my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong), the backend-extension-indexer tool generates the extension points (https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/) for core and some selected plugins (which are marked with @Extension).

This PR updated some criteria of this tool, which caused some failures because those 167 plugins are not modern enough (eg. they don't support Java 11 etc).

We agreed that this could be an "advanced" probe because it is not applicable to all plugins but only to some selected few. And this probe isn't concerned with the users so we can add this a little later in the future. Lmk if you have any thoughts on this
11/09/2022, 18:31:44 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny): AFAIK the tool actually tries to index all plugins, so the list of failures there may be a good indicator of which plugins are actually not able to run on Java 11. That may be a useful probe since many plugins may indicate Java 8 in POM and still run fine with both 8 and 11.
12/09/2022, 07:53:44 - Dheeraj: That is interesting, thanks for letting me know.
We will discuss this and plugin-site-issue (where you @ me) in our weekly meetings, and I'll propose to record these probe ideas somewhere so we can work on them.
12/09/2022, 10:09:23 - Dheeraj: Hi @alecharp,
I have completed a blog post on this project, I will open a PR on jenkins.io asap.
12/09/2022, 12:43:14 - Dheeraj: I've created a PR here: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5440 
cc: @jleon33
12/09/2022, 14:07:26 - Dheeraj: And now I'm working on PR-38.
Sorry for nudging, please don't mind it but how is it going on with the deployment? I need to add it to the form by tonight
12/09/2022, 14:12:43 - hervelemeur: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha):  It won't be deployed by tonight ^^
What do you need to add to your form? The url?
12/09/2022, 14:16:08 - Dheeraj: Yes 😟
This is what the form says:
12/09/2022, 14:16:14 - Dheeraj: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/6296203f6da037398497b03b/OTDa/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/6296203f6da037398497b03b/OTDa/image.png)
12/09/2022, 14:17:18 - hervelemeur: OK
12/09/2022, 14:18:09 - hervelemeur: Are you all OK with `plugin-health.jenkins.io`?
No `scoring` in it? (`plugin-health-scoring.jenkins.io`)
12/09/2022, 14:19:39 - Dheeraj: Out of curiosity, is `-scoring` clashing with something?
12/09/2022, 14:19:49 - hervelemeur: nothing
12/09/2022, 14:20:11 - hervelemeur: This url choice a matter of taste
12/09/2022, 14:20:59 - hervelemeur: `plugin-health.jenkins.io` comes from https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3114
12/09/2022, 14:24:35 - Dheeraj: Okay :thumbsup:, I don't have a strong preference. Let's go with: `plugin-health.jenkins.io`as long as you're okay with it.
12/09/2022, 14:24:52 - hervelemeur: Fine for me :)
12/09/2022, 14:25:10 - Dheeraj: awesome!
12/09/2022, 14:25:18 - hervelemeur: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha): I'd put this url in your form, even if there isn't anything here yet
12/09/2022, 14:27:15 - hervelemeur: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha):  if you create a simple html with the project description (and state?) and set it as a github page I can add a temporary DNS record to point to it as a placeholder while the deployment isn't ready
12/09/2022, 14:28:06 - hervelemeur: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
12/09/2022, 14:29:30 - hervelemeur: <del>it doesn't matter where you create the corresponding repository</del>, this page will get a https://\<user>.github.io/\<repository> url, I'll redirect plugin-health.jenkins.io to it, and will remove this redirection as soon as the project is ready.
12/09/2022, 14:30:00 - hervelemeur: KISS for now ;)
12/09/2022, 14:32:58 - hervelemeur: > it doesn't matter where you create the corresponding repository

scratch that, use this one: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring-placeholder-website
I'm setting up github page and the redirection on it.
12/09/2022, 14:41:51 - hervelemeur: https://jenkins-infra.github.io/plugin-health-scoring-placeholder-website/
12/09/2022, 14:42:00 - hervelemeur: use the gh-pages branch for the content
12/09/2022, 14:42:10 - hervelemeur: (I've added your team as maintainer)
12/09/2022, 14:43:29 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much Hervé for your help!

12/09/2022, 14:43:53 - Dheeraj: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/6296203f6da037398497b03b/AKVH/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/6296203f6da037398497b03b/AKVH/image.png)
12/09/2022, 14:44:07 - Dheeraj: This is what the current UI looks like as prepared by Adrien:
12/09/2022, 14:45:35 - Dheeraj: We're using Thymeleaf to do this (PR: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/27), just letting you know
12/09/2022, 14:49:31 - Dheeraj: okay, I'm looking into it
12/09/2022, 14:53:35 - hervelemeur: Useful link: https://docs.github.com/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll
12/09/2022, 14:54:21 - hervelemeur: Again, I wouldn't spend too much time on it.
Choose a theme, add a short description and that should be more than enough.
12/09/2022, 14:58:08 - hervelemeur: It's "live" now: https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/
12/09/2022, 14:58:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): why don't you use the github repository for the URL? 
12/09/2022, 14:58:39 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): we will put the URL of the deployed application on the repository once it's up
12/09/2022, 14:58:49 - hervelemeur: Yeah, better indeed. I went with a separate repo as it was faster for me to setup without interfering
12/09/2022, 14:59:56 - hervelemeur: we can revisit the current state, let me know
12/09/2022, 15:00:55 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm speaking mostly about the URL @dheerajodha could use in the form for GSoC
12/09/2022, 15:01:33 - hervelemeur: as shown in the screenshot, they suggest to use a definitive url as it can't be changed later
12/09/2022, 15:14:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the repository won't move.
12/09/2022, 15:21:22 - Dheeraj: @alecharp so you mean this: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring literally the repo URL?
I got confused with the GitHub pages site activated on this repo at: https://jenkins-infra.github.io/plugin-health-scoring/
12/09/2022, 15:23:14 - hervelemeur: > I got confused with the GitHub pages site activated on this repo at: https://jenkins-infra.github.io/plugin-health-scoring/

Ooohh... I'll remove the new repo and use this page, better.
And yes alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) means putting the repository url in your form, as it won't change, and will have a link to plugin-health.jenkins.io when finished.
12/09/2022, 15:30:56 - Dheeraj: Okay sure, earlier I thought I wouldn't have necessary permission to activate the GH pages site on this repo, but I was wrong

That makes total sense, thanks very much for your quick help!!
12/09/2022, 16:32:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): GH pages are generated based on a branch on the repository.
16/09/2022, 18:24:43 - jleon33 (jleon33): any help needed on the final slides @dheerajodha 
19/09/2022, 06:18:14 - Dheeraj: Hey @jleon33, sorry for the late reply I was on PTO when you texted
Yup, I need help, I'll put together the slides, and let's meet today (Monday) at around 5 pm UTC.
Would that work for you?
19/09/2022, 15:51:43 - Dheeraj: and/or tomorrow (your time), whatever works for you
19/09/2022, 17:12:53 - jleon33 (jleon33): just let me know when youd like to meet. we can set up a call
19/09/2022, 17:13:32 - jleon33 (jleon33): I can do 5pm UTC. I think thats 1pm EDT? that works fo rme

03/10/2022, 16:39:47 - jleon33 (jleon33): @jmmeessen:matrix.org is there a way to change the name of this chat (remove the GSoC part of it) so this can function as the main chat for the plugin health scoring discussions? Or would we be better off creating a new channel?
04/10/2022, 10:24:33 - Jmm: Hi jleon33 (jleon33) 
Will look into this later during the day. Otherwise we can alway create a new one (but loose the history)
04/10/2022, 16:10:38 - jleon33 (jleon33): thank you sir! 
07/10/2022, 12:08:47 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): either I lack the permission or it's not possible, but I didn't find a way to rename the gitter channel. based on https://github.com/ethereumjs/organization/issues/15#issuecomment-368826812 might need to involve gitter support..
07/10/2022, 14:16:42 - jmMeessen (Jean-Marc MEESSEN) joined the room
07/10/2022, 14:16:43 - jmMeessen (Jean-Marc MEESSEN): I checked and the easiest way to go is to create a new channel. And this will not break the links on the various pages where this channel is referenced. @jleon33 @alecharp 
07/10/2022, 19:03:03 - Dheeraj: Hello all, the PR is open for review. Please give it a look if you have time.

Any objections?
10/10/2022, 16:29:44 - hervelemeur: > @alecharp: as per  @hervelemeur:matrix.org's suggestion

10/10/2022, 16:35:12 - Dheeraj: Yes :thumbsup: 
Also,  @hervelemeur:matrix.org which one do you prefer?
`The URL plugin-health.jenkins.io is live` or `The site plugin-health.jenkins.io is live`
10/10/2022, 16:35:27 - hervelemeur: the second one :)
10/10/2022, 16:35:43 - Dheeraj: cool, ill update
10/10/2022, 16:36:49 - hervelemeur: I would inverse the phrase, putting "thanks to the helm chart.... on Kubernetes, the site ... is live."
10/10/2022, 16:37:17 - hervelemeur: as the helm chart isn't the only reason the site is live, if at first position it's not as much implied
10/10/2022, 16:37:46 - Dheeraj: Message deleted
10/10/2022, 16:38:27 - hervelemeur: the helm chart facilitated the app deployment, but isn't enough on its own, although sufficient as a short explanation of its usefullness.
10/10/2022, 16:41:39 - Dheeraj: thanks for the info :thumbsup:, I've update it now
11/10/2022, 16:39:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier):  @dheerajodha I need you to review https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/72 when you can. I commented on the files where it's important for you to say if you agree to the license or not
11/10/2022, 18:37:18 - Dheeraj: Done, thank you!
04/11/2022, 21:47:08 - jleon33 (jleon33): @dheerajodha how did your lightning talk go today? 
06/11/2022, 09:58:19 - Dheeraj: Hi @jleon33, thanks for asking!

It went really well! I had 3 minutes and I think I was able to describe the project, its need, status, and future, pretty clearly. A couple of fellow presenters like me, who I connected on LinkedIn after the summit, found the project interesting as well. There were over 100 people on the call all-throughout, so it was very cool

Unfortunately, they did not record any presentations which I found very weird. But they did offer a gift code to presenters and I selected a "Google ❤️ Open Source" TShirt 😃
07/11/2022, 13:24:24 - jleon33 (jleon33): very nice! thats great to hear
16/11/2022, 18:46:53 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha in case you are around, if you could review  https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/112 it would be great.
16/11/2022, 19:00:51 - Dheeraj: Done, thanks!
02/12/2022, 12:23:44 - Dheeraj: @alecharp I'm sorry for being silent on my PR https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/109
I'm visiting my hometown so I would be away from my laptop from Dec 3 to Dec 14. I wasn't able to make progress on the PR because I was wrapping up some unplanned tasks on priority before I leave. With that said, I'm still interested to work on the PR when I get back but please feel free to close it or pick it up if you feel like this task needs to be worked on priority.

20/01/2023, 10:58:30 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Hi, team just wanted to give a quick introduction. This is mandeep, I am an open source enthusiast looking forward to contribute to the plugin_health_score project and  make some valuable contributions.
20/01/2023, 10:59:03 - hervelemeur: Welcome!
20/01/2023, 11:05:47 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Hello Mandeep, glad to have you.
20/01/2023, 11:08:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so, in order to run the application locally, what you need to have is a local database running. You can start is as you wish, but there is an helper in the project in the form of a `docker compose` command: you can just run `docker compose run db -d` to start a database locally. This is using a `.env` file content to setup from credentials. You can see an example of that file in `.env.example`
20/01/2023, 11:14:59 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): once you have your database, you need to make sure those credentials are known by the spring-boot application. To do that, if you run the application from command line (`mvn spring-boot:run`) then you need to export manually the environment variables in your shell (or bash or whatever) 
20/01/2023, 11:15:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so it would be something like `export POSTGRES_HOST = localhost`,  `export POSTGRES_PORT=5432`, `export POSTGRES_USER=whatever`, etc.
20/01/2023, 11:16:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and only then, on the same shell, you can run `mvn spring-boot:run`
20/01/2023, 16:40:20 - Dheeraj: Welcome Mandeep!
20/01/2023, 16:48:54 - Dheeraj: @alecharp While running `mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn` the cron string for `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON` gives the following error:

```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Encountered invalid @Scheduled method 'run': Cron expression must consist of 6 fields (found 7 in "* 5 */2 * * * *")
```

I exported this variable manually beforehand with the value taken from the `.env.example` file. I ran this command in an attempt to reproduce this error posted by a candidate on the gsoc-sig channel. I made the cron string to be of 6 characters and it worked afterwards. Should we update the value in the `.env.example` file?
20/01/2023, 16:55:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it seems that the .env.example has some invalid values

I'm replying to his queries here so as to have public conversations which would benefit others as well, plus I can be corrected if my responses are incorrect :)

> ...I have never implemented CI/CD pipelines practically...

I don't think it's a strict requirement for this project to know CI/CD, it's more of a 'good-to-have' skill. Just FYI, the project repository has a CI in place, which is super useful. In general, it would be great if you're familiar with CI/CD because it's a super important concept in software development.

> I will be busy from 8am to 6pm in classes and some days classes happen at night also. I will not get more than 4-5hrs to code during Normal days...

As per the GSoC guidelines, contributors are expected to at least spend at least 20 hours a week on their project. So it's your call whether you'll be able to give this much time to your project.

> Will I have flexibility to work more on some days and less on other days or do I need to stick to the plans shared by mentors and mentioned in the timeline?

I think yes, you will have some flexibility given that you clearly communicate your plans in your project proposal. Sometimes exams fall in between the contributing period so that is taken into consideration on behalf of the contributor. Also, "plans" are not shared by the mentor(s). It is expected from the mentee to make a plan of how they'll be delivering their project in the GSoC time period, so it is up to you to design your own timeline as per your availability :)

> I don’t have any idea of UI/UX designing so does this project require the knowledge of UI as it’s not mentioned in the tech stack of the project. I can learn on the go btw as I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript!

For this project idea, it's not a strict requirement to have knowledge of UI. But it would be useful if the contributor has some experience because the selected contributor might need to play a little with the frontend files.

> How have you scraped data of plugins from the repos? ... But isn’t there an upper limit to the rate of scraping data by GitHub as there are 1000s of plugins!

This is a good question. For scraping, we're largely using https://github-api.kohsuke.org/ library and data from the Jenkins Update Center: https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json. Yes, we had some problems where the API limit got exceeded and the probe engine couldn't complete its operation due to this. To solve this, Adrien integrated a GitHub App into this project which gives us a very high API requests limit (I think it's 15,000 requests per hour), which seems to work well.

> Does this project include Score Calculation Algorithm improvements?

Not exactly. This project largely deals with adding new probes to the project. But since adding new probes would require the contributor to play with the probe coefficient, etc, so you might need to do some small tweaks in the algorithms to ensure the scores are correct.

> ...can I pick up some ideas from your proposal and also ask the community about the new probes and enhancements required...

Ofcourse! That's a good idea! :)

25/01/2023, 08:17:51 - impact-maker (impact-maker): In reference to the issue #181 we have to create the health score on top every plugin as well as refine the score system to make it more accurate.  What sort of parameters should the new scoring system comprise of .
25/01/2023, 11:21:07 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Hey! This is Harsh here. I  am currently in my freshman year, situated in India, and want to contribute to plugin health score. I was trying to understand the codebase from about a week. When I try running plugin-health-scoring-app-1, the app is starting up successfully, however it is exiting automatically without any error message(can share the logs if required). Its database is not exiting automatically and seems to be working fine. I am not able to comprehend why is this happening.I have installed jenkins lts and plugin health score app on the same port so maybe that's an issue(I changed the port in compose.yml to 8081:8081 but still isn't working. I think someone should change the ports form 8080:8080 to some other unoccupied port as it can be quite confusing for newcomers who already have jenkins container on their system to first exit it and then start plugin health container. If there is some special reason for having the same ports then please share the reason). Does plugin health scoring app require jenkins to run beforehand!? Whats the mistake from my side? And I also want to access the database of plugin health scoring app. Which SQL client in IDE are you folks using. I don't have much knowledge about it sorry?
And I also have to study about Collections, Streams and other advanced Java concepts. Dont know how to configure CI/CD pipelines and never practically wrote junit tests. I am quite a noob as I never contributed to Open Source before. I will try solving some good first issues of Jenkins later, maybe you can point me to some.  @dheerajodha @alecharp

> I changed the port in compose.yml to 8081:8081 but still isn't working

you should only change the export port as the application itself is still listening on port 8080. So change the port config to `8181:8080` or don't run Jenkins as the same time. It is not required to have a jenkins instance for the project
25/01/2023, 11:25:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > I think someone should change the ports form 8080:8080 to some other unoccupied port as it can be quite confusing for newcomers who already have jenkins container on their system to first exit it and then start plugin health container

it's up to you to know the available port on your computer. the compose is only here to show how you could run the application but it needs to be adapted to your need if necessary
25/01/2023, 11:26:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > If there is some special reason for having the same ports then please share the reason

it's not about having the same port. it's just that the application is listening on port 8080 and there is no reason the external port of the docker environment should listen on a different one
25/01/2023, 11:27:33 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Does plugin health scoring app require jenkins to run beforehand!?

no it doesn't. there is no mention of Jenkins on the contributing guide.
25/01/2023, 11:28:30 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): >  Which SQL client in IDE are you folks using. I don't have much knowledge about it sorry?

I'm using the client from IntelliJ IDEA

25/01/2023, 11:32:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > never practically wrote junit tests.

It's a good exercise to right one before the code, thinking "what is the code supposed to do?" once you have that clear in your mind you can right a unit test doing assertion of what your code should produce based on what you are feeding it. Then you can write your code. 
25/01/2023, 11:34:25 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > I will try solving some good first issues of Jenkins later, maybe you can point me to some.

Please know that this project code is not related to Jenkins code or any Jenkins plugins code. This is a completely different project. it aims at helping maintainer knows what they can focus on on their plugin, but that's all.

In the dockerfile a non root user 'phs' was created for some reason(please share the reason) and i am guessing that this same user is trying to create directory in #138 . Does this user have the necessary permissions to do so? @alecharp 
25/01/2023, 17:02:42 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > In the dockerfile a non root user 'phs' was created for some reason(please share the reason)

Because it's bad practice to run anything on a Docker container as root because you  might get root access on the host and so if the image / container is compromised, the host is as well.
25/01/2023, 17:03:16 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier):  > Does this user have the necessary permissions to do so?

it should as it's trying to create that folder in its USER_HOME

26/01/2023, 19:30:51 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @alecharp i am asking a pretty silly question but when i run plugin health score app 1 i am not getting this error! 
https://gist.github.com/30af2103262ddd126b3519a2f1d6026b.git
this is what i am getting by  running the app from docker. I actually dont know how to download plugins. I think i need to download some plugins for this error to show up! Kindly show me the way 😟
And i think in #138 to solve the issue i somehow need to make sure that the folder is not created multiple times. As the plugins are downloaded parallelly so creating a directory first and then downloading all the plugins in that directly seems to be a good solution to me. Can you tell me which probe is responsible for downloading plugins so that i can try my hands on this issue? 
27/01/2023, 10:27:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @impact-maker have you start your work off the existing pull-request or from scratch?
27/01/2023, 10:28:35 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @harsh-ps-2003 you need to run the probes once. it happens because the code is using jgit to clone the plugins repository. this only happens when you run the probes
27/01/2023, 10:31:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > As the plugins are downloaded parallelly so creating a directory first As the plugins are downloaded parallelly so creating a directory first 

this is a good way to go imo

> downloading all the plugins in that directly seems to be a good solution to me

the plugins are clones in the different directory. the directory which reports a problem is the git configuration directory. it's different from where the plugins are cloned.

> Can you tell me which probe is responsible for downloading plugins so that i can try my hands on this issue? 

the last commit date probe is the one cloning the repository first

There is no webhook url for this. Those are trigger with the schedulers and the CRON you have setup in the environment variables.

Probes are not in the database. They are classes in the `io.jenkins.pluginhealth.scoring.probes` package.
30/01/2023, 12:26:57 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > How can I setup this database in Database browser?

Create a data source with Postgresql driver. Normally, the database container has its ports 5432 redirected to the ports 5432 on your host. So you can set the url of the database to `localhost`, port `5432` and use the username and password that you setup in the `.env` file.

03/02/2023, 13:58:27 - Kris Stern: No worries impact-maker (impact-maker) We appreciate your contribution! 
04/02/2023, 15:32:07 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Hi @alecharp  currently I am not able to see the list of plugins and their respective set of old score(Last 5 to 10 scores). I would need some help/suggestion to reproduce the issue #193.
04/02/2023, 17:24:45 - Dheeraj: Sorry for the late response. On the terminal where you've run the command `docker compose up`, what do the logs say?

But since the `plugins` and `scores` table is empty, I think that the scheduled tasks were not executed. And by "scheduled tasks", I mean the ones whose frequency you've set in the cron expressions here in lines 12 and 14: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/.env.example

For testing, I like to set their frequency to be more frequent, eg. every 10-15 mins.
04/02/2023, 17:36:29 - Dheeraj: Sorry for the late response. I'm not sure which way you're running the app (via the "CLI" or "Docker Compose" method), but what exactly are you seeing? and what are you expecting to see?
05/02/2023, 11:11:22 - impact-maker (impact-maker): @alecharp @dheerajodha @jleon33 I am looking forward to implement the probe to see if spotbugs is configured/enabled. It would be really helpful to get some resources to implement and test a probe. Some insights on spotbugs would also be helpful. Also should I send across a introductory pull request for the issue made by @jleon33 as I have started the initial part of the frontend for the spotbug probe. 
05/02/2023, 13:40:31 - Kris Stern: Hi impact-maker (impact-maker) Even though I am not one of the potential mentors for the project, but as one of the GSoC org admins I would say it would be highly inappropriate to start to engage in any direct work that is supposed to be a significant part of the proposed GSoC project idea, as this seems like jumping the gun for me. 
05/02/2023, 13:42:28 - Kris Stern: This may in fact have a negative impact on your proposal getting selected
05/02/2023, 14:29:49 - Kris Stern: I do understand you have an interest in working on [#151](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/151), but while you are at it, do be careful of the scope of the task you take on. 
06/02/2023, 07:08:48 - Dheeraj: Refer to the contributing guide to see how to set up the project locally. I'm assuming you have done that already, so your database should already be populated with the plugins and their scores. To better understand your situation, what have you tried so far, and which error are you seeing?
06/02/2023, 10:07:31 - impact-maker (impact-maker): I have checked the database now it is showing the plugin as well as the scores. I was checking the frontend for the same, so wanted to confirm that does the frontend currently have only two tabs- One for probes list and the other scores list page and no tab for the plugin list(Only the database entries  stores the plugin list). 
06/02/2023, 10:45:03 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): no, the application is not meant to be listing the plugins
06/02/2023, 10:45:44 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): however, you can access the score of a specific plugin by taping the url `/scores/PLUGIN_NAME` (replacing `PLUGIN_NAME`)
06/02/2023, 10:47:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I wouldn't suggestion to start with this for now. This probe is rather complex and potentially blocked by a pull request I made on another project which hasn't been merged nor released.
06/02/2023, 10:49:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I would also suggest that you keep your focus on what you want to contribute because a week ago, you offered to look into https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/193, which is not part of any GSoC project so it's fine for that, but you haven't proposed anything about it. 
06/02/2023, 10:51:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > I have started the initial part of the frontend for the spotbug probe. 

I'm not sure I understand because probes don't have frontend development requirement.
06/02/2023, 21:33:48 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Hi  @alecharp  I needed some more clarity on the problem statement.
06/02/2023, 21:39:31 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Currently I am able to see two scores fetched for every plugin id for two specific dates. So are we looking to fetch only the top 5-10 scores in database table or every plugin we just want the latest 5 scores. Any screenshot on the current issue would be quite helpful to fully understand the problem statement.
06/02/2023, 21:43:45 - impact-maker (impact-maker): @alecharp I was trying to work on both the issues/enhancements to get a better code coverage and understanding. Will try to  work on the scoring issue for now and avoid getting my hands on spotbugs probe as suggested by @jleon33.
07/02/2023, 10:00:45 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): we just want to keep 5 scores for each plugin
07/02/2023, 10:01:08 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm not sure what screenshot you might need.. 
08/02/2023, 07:08:55 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,
 

Can someone explain me what UpdateCenter does?

Here is what I have understood: 

`UpdateCenter.java` is an empty class.

 

In `ProbeEngine.java` `UpdateCenter` is called this way: 

`final UpdateCenter updateCenter = updateCenterService.fetchUpdateCenter();`

`fetchUpdateCenter()` reads and returns an URL. 

Also, from `ProbeContext` class I understand, it gives additional information about each probe like: lastCommitData, github repo, etc. 
08/02/2023, 07:20:57 - Jagruti: Even in `ProbeContext` it return `UpdateCenter`. How does it function?

```
    public ProbeContext(String pluginName, UpdateCenter updateCenter) throws IOException {
        this.updateCenter = updateCenter;
        this.scmRepository = Files.createTempDirectory(pluginName);
    }

    public UpdateCenter getUpdateCenter() {
        return updateCenter;
    }

```

08/02/2023, 08:50:56 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Hi @alecharp corresponding to each plugin id I can see just 2 scores of some specific dates. Could you let me know how to reproduce the last 5-10 scores corresponding to each plugin id. This was the screenshot I was talking about in the last thread
08/02/2023, 13:10:57 - Jagruti: Hey
 
 Can someone explain me the difference between:

https://github.com/Jagrutiti/plugin-health-scoring/blob/d30b46817dba4ac5d2aea8decfaaaf0f982e805d/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/probes/DeprecatedPluginProbe.java#L45 
 
and

08/02/2023, 13:11:18 - Jagruti: These are two different lines of `DeprecatedPluginProbe` to call the update-center.
 
First one with `ProbeContext` object second one using `updateCenter.Plugin`
08/02/2023, 13:11:27 - Jagruti: I know it is the syntax I do not understand how `plugins()` came into the picture in line no. 49?
08/02/2023, 13:14:40 - Jagruti: This line is similar too:

https://github.com/Jagrutiti/plugin-health-scoring/blob/d30b46817dba4ac5d2aea8decfaaaf0f982e805d/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/scores/DeprecatedPluginScoring.java#L51

When I do `final ProbeResult deprecatedPluginProbeResult = plugin.` intellij does not suggest `getDetails()` method.

08/02/2023, 14:23:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): This is the Java representation of the update-center file
08/02/2023, 14:23:46 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > fetchUpdateCenter() reads and returns an URL. 

not quite. it reads the file behind an URL and returns the content of that file
08/02/2023, 14:24:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Also, from ProbeContext class I understand, it gives additional information about each probe like: lastCommitData, github repo, etc. 
08/02/2023, 14:24:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): correct
08/02/2023, 14:25:19 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): This is so, when we are executing all the probes on each individual plugin, we are not trying to download the update center every single time.
08/02/2023, 14:25:42 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this way, the update-center is downloaded once, at the beginning of the probeengine execution 
08/02/2023, 14:26:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it also makes sure that the same update-center content is used for all the plugins
08/02/2023, 14:27:25 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this means that the scoreengine produced only 2 scores for each plugin so far in your local environment. 
08/02/2023, 14:27:47 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Change your `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON` environment variable to produce more of them
08/02/2023, 14:29:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): The first one is assigning to a local variable the reference to a `UpdateCenter` object which is referenced in the `ProbeContext` object passed as a parameter of the method
08/02/2023, 14:30:39 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the second one is assigning to a local variable the reference of an update-center `Plugin` which can be retrieved from the `plugins` map in the `UpdateCenter` object
08/02/2023, 14:34:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): note that those are two different classes
08/02/2023, 14:39:53 - Dheeraj: just for reference, this is where the update center URL is getting read from: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/2ebf654ed43a68deb9adebb8c127ae9f0729a5e5/src/main/resources/application.yaml#L22
08/02/2023, 14:40:19 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes
08/02/2023, 14:40:44 - Dheeraj: You can use any of the online websites which print JSON in a prettier way, that would help you look at the data stored in the update-center more clearly.
08/02/2023, 14:51:31 - Dheeraj: Are you sure? we are not "calling update-center using updateCenter.Plugin" on Line 49. `....updateCenter.Plugin` is the **type** of `updateCenterPlugin` variable.


08/02/2023, 14:59:56 - Dheeraj: might be something fishy going on in your IDE, but have you tried using a debugger? that would help answer a lot of your questions.

so basically you removed line 51 and started rewriting word by word and not getting suggestions for `getDetails()` after `plugin.`? i wouldn't worry too much about it, maybe its just a flaky behavior of your IDE.
08/02/2023, 15:06:53 - Jagruti: >so basically you removed line 51 and started rewriting word by word and not getting suggestions for getDetails() after plugin.

Yes I did just that. 

If IDE does not prompt it gets a little difficult in understanding. 
08/02/2023, 15:07:20 - Jagruti: It did not prompt for `getDetails()` after `=`
08/02/2023, 15:10:49 - Dheeraj: maybe you need to enable code completion in your IDE
08/02/2023, 15:13:00 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please note that what I asked was a probe and you are for the moment speaking about Scoring process. Those are two different thing. Did you create the new probe first?

like should I be connecting to localhost port to open it up?
11/02/2023, 11:31:02 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): > first: .env file is supposed to be in the root directory, right?

Yes, the root of the project
11/02/2023, 11:31:34 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): > `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_NAME` takes my username, and `GITHUB_APP_ID` takes my the id no. displayed on the github app configuration page

11/02/2023, 13:16:44 - Dheeraj: @MondalSayantan: I tried to answer your question, sending it here as a separate message because it would be useful for others too.

There are 4 general parts to writing a new probe in this project:

---------------

(A) Research and implement the probe logic:

I think your probe needs to search for files like "CONTRIBUTING.md" or "CONTRIBUTING.adoc" within the given plugin's repository and accordingly record the results. For this, go through the current list of the implemented probes and see how they do this, I think some of them might be closely related to this probe.

---------------

(B) Then integrate your probe with the probe engine: For this, you need to read the probe definition files of the ones which are currently present within the repo and see how they make use of the interface they are extending (notice extends Probe on each probe class).

---------------- 

(C) Write the scoring file for this probe:

Refer to other scoring files and think about how the result of this probe can be used here. Feel free to discuss this.

---------------- 

(D) Write tests for each file you add:

Very crucial. You need to write tests for the probe and scoring file. The best idea to know how is to look at the currently written tests.

----------------

General tip: Please feel free to have discussions on this channel about your approaches or doubts or anything. Also, maybe @alecharp can add something to this if I missed anything.
11/02/2023, 14:23:09 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Thank you @dheerajodha, this is really helpful :)
11/02/2023, 14:25:53 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): My approach, which is also Mark's idea, is to look into how the `jenkinsfile` probe is working and take a reference from there. The probe should give me a Boolean value which I can use for scoring
12/02/2023, 08:28:40 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Message deleted
12/02/2023, 09:33:27 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I am trying to understand how the probe engine is getting the scm link, visiting the link and checking if files like `Jenkinsfile` are present. 

In `ProbeEngine.java`, I can see a line of code in the `runOn` method
`final ProbeResult result = probe.apply(plugin, probeContext);`
Which I think is doing the job of visiting the scm link and finding the files.

But in `Probe.java`, in class `Probe` there  are two methods
`public final ProbeResult apply(Plugin plugin, ProbeContext context) {  
    return doApply(plugin, context);  
}`
`protected abstract ProbeResult doApply(Plugin plugin, ProbeContext context);`
 which has a Java doc

     /**  
     * Perform the analyze on a plugin * * @param plugin the plugin on which the analyze is done  
     * @param context holder of information passed across the probes executed on a single plugin  
     * @return a ProbeResult representing the result of the analyze  
     */
 And in `JenkinsfileProbe.java`, the `doApply` method is overriden with the code

     Final Path repository = context.getScmRepository();
        try (Stream<Path> paths =  Files
        .find(repository, 1, (file, basicFileAttributes) ->  Files.isReadable(file) &&  "Jenkinsfile".equals(file.getFileName().toString()))
        ) {
        return paths.findFirst()
        .map(file ->  ProbeResult.success(key(), "Jenkinsfile found"))
        .orElseGet(() ->  ProbeResult.failure(key(), "No Jenkinsfile found"));

which is traversing the Files and finding if Jenkinsfile is present in it with a depth of 1.

In `ProbeContext` we are using this

     this.scmRepository = Files.createTempDirectory(pluginName);
which I think is creating a file system with the plugin name.

I am not able to figure out where we are actually visiting the scm link (The GitHub URL) and storing the information.

Also in Plugin.java,

    public Plugin addDetails(ProbeResult newProbeResult) {  
        this.details.compute(newProbeResult.id(), (s, previousProbeResult) -> {  
            return Objects.equals(previousProbeResult, newProbeResult) ? previousProbeResult : newProbeResult;  
      });  
     return this;}  
      
    public Plugin addDetails(Map<String, ProbeResult> details) {  
        details.values().forEach(this::addDetails);  
     return this;}
I am not able to understand how and where they are being used. But I think the previous probe results mean there is already information in the database related to the plugin, and we would add the new details if the information is stale

13/02/2023, 05:25:38 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): After more research, I think my answer lies in ProbeContext.java, in these lines of codes.

    public ProbeContext(String pluginName, UpdateCenter updateCenter) throws IOException {
        this.updateCenter = updateCenter;
        this.scmRepository = Files.createTempDirectory(pluginName);
    }

    public UpdateCenter getUpdateCenter() {
        return updateCenter;
    }

    public Path getScmRepository() {
        return scmRepository;
    }
`final Path repository = context.getScmRepository();`is providing us the complete repository (which means the Github Repo) needed for a probe.

I am not able to find where we are calling the constructor and setting the values.
13/02/2023, 05:28:32 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi @dheerajodha, could you please correct me where I am going wrong and also provide some hints?
13/02/2023, 11:57:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): The plugin code is cloned by the `LastCommitDateProbe` class. So be sure that your probe is executed after that one (see the  `@Order` on the probes class). Once it is cloned, the path to the repository is stored in the context. So you need to get the value from the context. be sure to check it's not `null` nor `invalid`.
13/02/2023, 12:01:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): once you have the path of the local clone of the plugin, you can explore it. Please see the GitHub documentation, as contributing guide can be in several places within a repository.
13/02/2023, 12:04:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): One major thing about what @dheerajodha said: you don't need to touch the code of the ProbeEngine to implement a new Probe. You need to implement the method of that class (`Probe`) accordingly to what your probe requires (needs a new release to have a different outcome? needs the source code of the plugin to have changed to have a different outcome?). 
13/02/2023, 12:05:55 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): You don't need to use the `addDetails` of `Plugin`, the `ProbeEngine` does that for you (if it is required). 
13/02/2023, 12:09:00 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the method `apply` is called by the `ProbeEngine` and was meant to be able to do some "cleanup" is required on all probe implementation without having to touch every single implementation. The method to implement is `doApply`. And because `apply` is `final` you cannot override it anyway.
13/02/2023, 17:04:58 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) , dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha)

Thank you for approving my latest PR.

I am interested in this idea for GSoC 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/add-probes-to-plugin-health-score/

Could you give me feedback in (based on my last PR) what areas I should work on to create a strong proposal?

I have been doing my research in the background. Trying to understand the code, watching old Jenkins videos, reading proposals, etc.

Please suggest some issues I should work on to understand the idea. Or what next steps should I follow.
13/02/2023, 17:29:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): We already have ideas for some probes, but it would be nice if in the proposal you can come up with your own idea, to show us you understand the project purpose. 
13/02/2023, 17:30:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Having tests and clear scenario of how probes should work, with external resources if you are using any, documentation links.
13/02/2023, 18:02:46 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha do you have time to review https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/205?
13/02/2023, 18:03:41 - Dheeraj: Sure thing, I'll try to do some of it now. And most of it tomorrow (12 hrs from now).
13/02/2023, 18:07:19 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Thank you @alecharp. I had forgotten to add the `@Order` annotation for which I was facing some problems
13/02/2023, 18:12:10 - Dheeraj: Glad to know! Feel free to ask any more questions that you might be having!
13/02/2023, 18:47:14 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): > The plugin code is cloned by the `LastCommitDateProbe` class. 


13/02/2023, 18:48:28 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I was wondering, if something can be done to separate the cloning of the repositories and the probe job. Would it be a right design decision?
13/02/2023, 18:50:05 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): It might be irrelevant but I am very curious to know the answer :)

No worries about the documentation link, thanks for adding those! But I'm not sure if I'll be a good "code reviewer" on this PR, I'll try my best

Also, full disclosure, I'll be on PTO from tomorrow till Monday, so I'll be inactive for these days. I'd be able to give PR#211 a look when I come back (if it still remains open by then).

This is absolutely not a problem, however, you might want to make sure to have the same Git user configuration in both.

16/02/2023, 15:14:30 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if you want your contributions on this project to have always your personal email, you can also have conditional configuration https://agateau.com/2015/splitting-your-gitconfig/

16/02/2023, 15:16:48 - Jagruti: Thank you. Open source contributions is my personal work. I will have a look at this. 
16/02/2023, 16:15:24 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) 

I was thinking, can we add a new probe (apart from the ones mentioned in GSoC idea page)

that would test the popularity of the plugin based on how many times it has been downloaded or installed?
16/02/2023, 16:19:21 - Jagruti: Another probe could be:

- how often new bugs are created by the user
- how quickly they are resolved

Based on these parameters.

What do you think?
16/02/2023, 17:02:26 - Jagruti: In the Contributing to Open source doc. 

There is a there are three video links  that explain how to resolve security issues.

Can we create a probe that rates plugins based on the number of security issues? 
16/02/2023, 17:06:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): all those are good ideas. as Kris Stern said, I would like to keep as much of the GSoC projects idea as possible. So I would recommend not to implement any new probe until then.
16/02/2023, 17:09:40 - Jagruti: I was thinking of adding these ideas in my GSoC proposal. As you told me that I should add my ideas to showcase my understanding of the project. 
16/02/2023, 17:15:39 - Jagruti: Also in my proposal should I explain the logic of how I will build each probe? How it would be used? 
16/02/2023, 17:17:14 - Jagruti: One more thing before starting my proposal do you want me to pick any other issue? For better understanding of the project? 

I mean, do you think I can start with the proposal or I should work on a few more issues to strengthen my case? 
17/02/2023, 10:12:45 - Jagruti: I did this configuration. How do I make sure git uses different email ids in different directory. 
17/02/2023, 10:13:17 - Jagruti: I tried other links: 

https://www.flother.is/til/git-commit-different-emails-home-work-repos/

But it did not work .
17/02/2023, 10:14:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): ok I didn't understand that. 
17/02/2023, 10:16:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the details of the implementation don't need to be part of the proposal but how you design it, how it would interact with other ones (needs to be executed before/after this probe), what value it offers and yes, how it could contribute to the score
17/02/2023, 10:17:08 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you don't need to work on any other issue for your proposal, but you are welcome to. be sure to not let that distract you from making your proposal that's all

What is the difference between `value` and `coefficient`. And why do we hash a `key`? What unique purpose does hashing serves? 
19/02/2023, 11:39:09 - Jagruti: Also I have noticed, at times `value` is harcoded when passed on `ScoreResult`. 0 in case of failures and 1 other wise.

Here it is. I have calculated values based on code. But now when I learned the difference between value and score I am confused. 
21/02/2023, 07:14:09 - Dheeraj: (deleted my previous message by mistake, hence typing it again)

This page: https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/probes/results is used to quickly look at the results of each probe which ran on ALL the plugins present in the update-center.

So, here the 1913 is the total number of plugins which we are currently running the probes on. If you check tomorrow or a week from now this number will change because maybe some plugin will get deprecated (and hence removed from update-center) or maybe some new plugins will get added.
21/02/2023, 07:16:49 - Dheeraj: For example, for the `jenkinsfile` probe, the probe results page (at `/probes/results`) informs us that from the total of 1913 Jenkins plugins, 1174 of them has a Jenkinsfile present in their repository.

Is this helpful?
21/02/2023, 07:25:03 - Jagruti sent an image. (Media omitted)
21/02/2023, 07:27:56 - Dheeraj: > How do I understand the score calculation?

You can take a look at how the demo scores are calculated in my last year's proposal (as already shared by Kris in another thread). In my proposal wherever I've mentioned "weights" it means same as "coefficients" (which is the term we are using in our project). This will give you an idea on how we calculate the scores via the score calculation algorithm (which is just weighted average).

> How was the total score obtained?

Then move on to the code to understand how we  (Adrien) implemented this algorithm. The implementation shares similarity with how we calculated the probes values using the probe engine.
21/02/2023, 07:32:03 - Jagruti: In this table from dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) in the existing proposal I do not understand how are the values added in the Plugin 1, Plugin 2, Plugin 3 column for `Parent POM`, `Jenkinsfile` and other probes.

For `No. of open PRs` probe and `Average time to review PRs` it is evident that 500 and 50 is the max total value. How did the value 10/500, 17/500, 3/50. What does the value in the numerator mean here?
21/02/2023, 07:39:23 - Dheeraj: The "probe values' can be either boolean (0 or 1, signifying the presence of absence of something) or discrete (measuring the exact value of the probe like for "No. of open issues" the value can NOT be boolean, it could be something like 5 or 10 or 23, etc).

> I do not understand how are the values added in the Plugin 1, Plugin 2, Plugin 3 column for Parent POM, Jenkinsfile and other probes.

Those are random values. I added them to show evaluators how the final score can be calculated.
This table's main focus was not on the values, but on how the values can be used to get a final score.

> How did the value 10/500, 17/500, 3/50

I didn't get your question.

> What does the value in the numerator mean here?

Probe value.
21/02/2023, 07:43:16 - Dheeraj: > What is the difference between value and coefficient.

Key: Unique identification of a scoring implementation.
Value: Score value.
Coefficient: A value between 0 and 1 which signifies how strongly we want to apply the probe on a plugin while calculating its score.
21/02/2023, 08:48:39 - Jagruti: Thank you so much. This was really helpful. 
21/02/2023, 09:18:05 - Jagruti: I will make changes to the proposal based on this new understanding. 
21/02/2023, 11:06:14 - Dheeraj: I would also wait for Adrien to correct me if I'm spreading straight up incorrect information.
21/02/2023, 11:06:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): probe results are not like score value. they are just observation over the plugin setup. The message of the probe can carry value which are indication on the probe result. 
Score value are an interpretation of one or multiple probe result based on choice we made to represent the plugin health.
21/02/2023, 11:08:53 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): probe result status can be error (meaning the project couldn't test the probe correctly), failure (meaning the plugin don't have the requirement to validate the probe) or success (meaning the probe could test the plugin)
21/02/2023, 11:09:12 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the scoring implementations take probe result and determine based on its status and "message" content is required if the plugin is healthy or not. 
21/02/2023, 11:12:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm not sure I'm answering the question Jagruti ..
21/02/2023, 11:16:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the score of a plugin is the average score of all the scoring implementation applied to a plugin. those are using probe result to evaluate a plugin
21/02/2023, 11:42:15 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) this is my draft proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14URAapu7svkj1pgw3yoCybwn766Net9SZ9coC4zx7yg/edit#heading=h.3lp9fznrbf55

It is still work in work-in-progress. Could you give a look at the Implementation section? 


It will help me understand where I am going wrong? What things I have to work on. 
21/02/2023, 11:42:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it's in my todo list yes. I will have a look by the end of my day.
21/02/2023, 11:43:09 - Jagruti: Thank you so much.

21/02/2023, 15:09:44 - Jagruti: Thank you Jmm dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) Kris Stern it would mean a lot to me. 
21/02/2023, 15:36:12 - Jagruti: In my proposal I should have columns like: key, value, coefficient?
21/02/2023, 16:07:04 - Dheeraj: Short answer:
I think that would make sense.


Long answer:
The main aim of the proposal is to present a project plan in front of the evaluators. The plan should consist of in-depth details of what you aim to do this summer if given a chance. So, more detailed plan you write, the more easily the evaluators will be able to understand what you aim to do, how you to do, and also know about which parts of the project you actually understood, because we do not have much idea about what you understood and what you didn't. So, the aim is to convince the evaluators that you understood the project very well and present a very nice to-the-point plan on what you intend to work on this summer. So, if you're showing the coefficient and value of a scoring implementation, it would help us understood how important you think the given scoring implementation is. So, yes sure, feel free to add whatever you like to, it's YOUR proposal, customize it as per your liking to put forward your point strongly.

21/02/2023, 18:05:42 - Jagruti: To calculate score, each plugin is fetched from the database. Data like scm, release timestamp, version, plugin details are fetched from them.

The `Set<ScoreResult> details` type the `jsonb` data is fetched from the database.

The `ScoreResult` has three values: `key`, `value` and `coefficient` from the database.


The formula to calculate the score is: 
 
`sum` = `value` * `coefficient`
of all the elements in the `detail` list.

`coefficient` = `sum of all coefficents` in the `details` list.

`value` = Math.round(100 * (sum / coefficient));

is this understanding correct?

21/02/2023, 18:11:55 - Jagruti: Now, if I add `coefficient` and `score` column to  the table in `New additions to the existing probes`  section? Would that be sufficient implementation details based on Adrien comments? 
22/02/2023, 09:58:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > The Set\<ScoreResult> details type the jsonb data is fetched from the database.

Not the set of scoreresult mais de set of proberesult
22/02/2023, 09:59:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > is this understanding correct?

it is basically how you compute an average for your grades in school yes
22/02/2023, 10:02:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you don't add a column for the scores. everything is done in the Java class `Score`. When you add a new detail, it recompute the value of the score based on the set of scoreresults
22/02/2023, 10:04:00 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the implementation details in the scoring implementation is basically "how important should this implementation be compared to others" "what probe should this scoring implementation rely on to evaluate a plugin"
22/02/2023, 10:04:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the entire "score / value" management is done in the `ScoreEngine` which you probably won't have to  touch
22/02/2023, 10:22:22 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): do you want me to send you the test class I wrote for your pull request? 
22/02/2023, 10:50:32 - Sayantan Mondal: I am trying to write the test cases myself and I'll only be able to work on them from next week as my exams are from tomorrow. But I would love to have a look. Thanks alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier)
22/02/2023, 10:51:42 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Sayantan Mondal: please focus on your exams and on the proposal. I'll commit my test class in your pull request so that you can check it out when you have more time. good luck (for the exams)

22/02/2023, 11:17:34 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

I have added a new Probe Scoring table in the `Implementation` section of my draft proposal.

Please do let me know if I have got the implementation details, scoring, order of execution right or not.
22/02/2023, 11:23:36 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier)Dheeraj: In the GSoC project ideas, I can see two ideas for this project - adding probes to the "Plugin Health Score" and displaying Plugin Health Scores. I understand the kind of proposal that is expected from us for the former idea, but I am not sure about the latter one. I am more inclined towards the second idea as I have a solid understanding of Reactjs and other frontend technologies, which I can see are requirements for it.

Could you please provide some hints on what is expected? Also, can we design a proposal that has both of these ideas together?
22/02/2023, 12:45:37 - Kris Stern: Sorry to barge in MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal) But acting as an org admin I just wanted to stress that you can have only one proposal for one project idea. 
22/02/2023, 12:48:44 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Understood
22/02/2023, 12:49:22 - Kris Stern: But you can of course submit two proposals for two project ideas
22/02/2023, 12:50:51 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): hi Sayantan Mondal are you working on this proposal?

if not i'd like to take it up, I was a bit busy the past week with acads and I see a lot has happened here. :')
22/02/2023, 12:51:31 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I'm active again though
22/02/2023, 13:11:10 - Kris Stern: Hi yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat) I think we can have more than one potential contributors writing a GSoC proposal for the same project idea, so there is no conflict there and according to Google no collaboration is allowed in preparing your proposals. 
22/02/2023, 13:11:46 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): great then!
I'll try and work on it.
22/02/2023, 13:14:34 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/193

have resumed working on this issue, so sorry for the week long inactivity.

so Dheeraj suggested for setting up `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON` to a more frequent value, I've changed the expression to fire the probe every 2 mins (just to observe if there are any changes in the probe results page). 

I still get 0/1889 for every probe, is that expected?
22/02/2023, 13:36:45 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): now, as far as the scores are concerned, from what I understand, they are being stored in a db.

my job is to just keep latest 5 of them and delete the rest of them from the db, right? 

taken cue from https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/repository/ScoreRepository.java
22/02/2023, 13:39:21 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): do tell me if I'm going the right way. 
22/02/2023, 13:40:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): correct direction
22/02/2023, 13:41:11 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): normally you shouldn't get 0/1889 on everything.
22/02/2023, 13:41:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): have you configured your GitHub App correctly? Are you sure you provided the correct key file (converted one)? 
22/02/2023, 13:42:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay!
and like, how to know which filed do I have to make changes (i.e. write the query to the db)?
22/02/2023, 13:42:54 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "have you configured your GitHub ..."> afaik yes, but I'll check and if needed redo the process to be sure
22/02/2023, 13:43:33 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): You should have to create a new class which should try to get all the scores for each plugins and delete the oldest ones
22/02/2023, 13:44:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): understood. working on it
22/02/2023, 13:44:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please note that if you haven't been working with database for very long, this might not be as friendly as it should be
22/02/2023, 13:46:08 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I have worked with dbs before, idk if that is sufficient to get this going. But ig I'll try it, hope I'm able to get the task done.
22/02/2023, 13:47:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): to try to answer the first questions Sayantan Mondal , the idea of this second project is to display the score of a plugin on its page in plugins.jenkins.io. the proposal should evaluate the state of the code in plugin health scoring project but also in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site and https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site-api as the GSoC project will have to contribute to those repositories as well
22/02/2023, 13:48:16 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it should be. 
22/02/2023, 13:48:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): let me know if you need more details
22/02/2023, 13:49:14 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): sure!
22/02/2023, 13:49:33 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and as Kris Stern said, don't hesitate to propose something for both GSoC project. 
22/02/2023, 17:02:57 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I still get 0/1889 for all probes, I re-did the Github app creation process :(
22/02/2023, 17:17:47 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): image.png (Media omitted)
22/02/2023, 17:18:06 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): image.png (Media omitted)
22/02/2023, 17:19:24 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the 2 tables, `plugins` and `scores` in my postgres container look like this. `0/1889` shows up because my score table is empty right?
22/02/2023, 17:22:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): scores != probe results.
22/02/2023, 17:23:17 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay. so the scores table is supposed to be empty?
22/02/2023, 17:23:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the 0/1889 is because non of the 1889 plugins have a successful probe result for the probe in questions (all of them)
22/02/2023, 17:23:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this is probably because the SCMLinkValidationProbe was not successful (many others depends on that)
22/02/2023, 17:24:48 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if that is also the case of the DeprecatedPluginProbe, please check that the ProbeEngine (PROBE_ENGINE_CRON env variable) was setup such as it ran at least once
22/02/2023, 17:26:59 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I've set `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON= 0 */2 * * * *` , the ProbeEngine is supposed to fire in every 2 mins, I suppose it must have run at least once
22/02/2023, 17:27:16 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): should I post my docker compose logs as a gist?
22/02/2023, 17:28:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): can you visualize the column `details` on the plugins table? is it empty (aka `{}`) or is there any json object?
22/02/2023, 17:28:53 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if so, please run the SQL script
```
UPDATE plugins
SET details = details::jsonb - 'scm';
```
22/02/2023, 17:29:35 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this will remove the `scm` key from the details object in db so that the SCMLinkValidationProbe is ran again on the next try
22/02/2023, 17:30:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if still no `SUCCESS` status in the `details` object, then it means you haven't configured correctly the GitHubAPP
22/02/2023, 17:30:21 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): details column has `{}` empty json for every plugin
22/02/2023, 17:30:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): wait. you run everything in from the docker-compose?
22/02/2023, 17:30:44 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes
22/02/2023, 17:32:20 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I just checked the logs: I get a `NoSuchFileException` for my converted key, although the path for .env file is correctly pointing to the converted file
22/02/2023, 17:32:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it is likely that the `.pem` file set in GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH is not in the docker container
22/02/2023, 17:33:13 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes I suppose so
should I exec into the container and place the key there?
22/02/2023, 17:33:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so, you need to tweak the compose.yml file
22/02/2023, 17:33:30 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): right
22/02/2023, 17:34:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): add in the `app` service something like
```
volumes:
  - "./converted-github-app.pem:/app/converted-github-app.pem:ro"
```
(check the indentation so that it's in the `app` section)
22/02/2023, 17:35:44 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): `/app/converted-github-app.pem:ro` this to be replaced with the actual path to the converted key on my system right?
22/02/2023, 17:35:45 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): of course, change the first part of the volume (before the `:`) to match the local name of the file, and the second part of the volume to make the `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` env var
22/02/2023, 17:36:03 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): got ot
22/02/2023, 17:36:04 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): it*
22/02/2023, 17:36:10 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): no the opposite. `local : container`
22/02/2023, 17:37:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you'll need to run the SQL script I posted before
22/02/2023, 17:39:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): ```
    volumes:
        - "/home/shreya/Downloads/CONVERTED_KEY.pem:/app/CONVERTED_KEY.pem:ro"
```

have done this.
22/02/2023, 17:39:09 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "you'll need to run the SQL scrip..."> right
22/02/2023, 17:39:51 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the first leg of the volume can be `./this-file-on-the-project-root-level`
22/02/2023, 17:41:56 - Dheeraj: yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I'm also curious about what you see on your console when you run `mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev`

That would also give us a hint of whether the probe engine executed or not.
22/02/2023, 17:42:19 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the f..."> I didn't understand that completely. Should I move my converted key to the project root and then put this in the first leg of the volume?
22/02/2023, 17:43:22 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > I didn't understand that completely. Should I move my converted key to the project root and then put this in the first leg of the volume?

I generally find it easier to have the file within the project folder that's all
22/02/2023, 17:43:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): personal choice. you do as you like on your computer 
22/02/2023, 17:43:54 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay!
22/02/2023, 17:45:17 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): running the sql script, and then `mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev`, I'll post the result
22/02/2023, 17:46:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): be careful with the `mvn` command that the `.env` file is not used. so you need to manually `export POSTGRES_DB=xxx` for each variable
22/02/2023, 17:47:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and if you don't have a db running, you still need to run `docker compose up -d db` (that's what I do)
22/02/2023, 17:47:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): ^ this method might not seem like the easiest, but it's quick to get feedback when you are implementing something new.
22/02/2023, 17:51:53 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay, so I ran the sql script. I still get an empty json in the details column
22/02/2023, 17:55:52 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): that is, I need to pass env varfiables in the command line itself?

`mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -D<variable>=<value>` like this?
22/02/2023, 17:56:19 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): wait for the probe engine to ran again
22/02/2023, 17:56:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): no you need to

22/02/2023, 18:53:34 - Kris Stern: Maybe it is a personal preference, but if the proposal is a lot more detailed / verbose it would be better. Because then there will be less margin of misunderstanding. Also, a mini-timeline for the different stages for the project progression would be ideal. 
22/02/2023, 18:54:41 - Kris Stern: Even though an accurate timeline would be unrealistic, a complete and detailed timeline to be approximately followed would tell us how knowledgeable you are with the project idea and how well you will be able to self-manage the project.

in the `open source contribution` section, I have only added the PR links of my contribution to Jenkins project. 

Shall I add the description and PR link of other projects too? It will be a long list that is why I have just mentioned their names. 

23/02/2023, 07:20:58 - Kris Stern: I used to do that when I was a potential contributor, it is more explanatory and I chose the more significant PR's to include.

23/02/2023, 15:58:40 - Harsh Gupta: while going through https://github.com/Harsh3341/plugin-site/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md i findTo aid with development mode, an environment variable of GET_CONTENT is needed to force gatsby to pull down the slow wiki/github content for each plugin
23/02/2023, 16:10:37 - Dheeraj: oh, different project. I haven't tried building plugin-site, but I can figure that this var accepts a boolean input ("true" or "false"), where "true" value would fetch all the wiki/github related content of each plugin, and vice versa.

I'd pass a value of "true" in order to see plugin content locally. I hope someone will correct me if I'm wrong.
23/02/2023, 16:29:23 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): are there any resources to understand what is the difference between a probe and a score?
23/02/2023, 16:33:28 - Dheeraj: Related: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.adoc
23/02/2023, 16:36:36 - Dheeraj: alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I read your message somewhere on this channel where you mentioned that you're working on a big revamp of the documentation of this project. Can you please tell me more about what you're aiming to do?
23/02/2023, 16:36:59 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): not just the documentation
23/02/2023, 16:37:12 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/206
23/02/2023, 16:39:12 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): thanks!
23/02/2023, 16:42:40 - Dheeraj: wow, big PR 🙂
23/02/2023, 16:43:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes. 
23/02/2023, 16:44:05 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm adding a few things but because I'm breaking so many things, I'm waiting for the current active PR to be done because it let me handle the merge conflicts on my own
23/02/2023, 16:48:28 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): hi, there's a thread just a few messages above, I was setting up the project myself, and adrian helped me out. that could be helpful
23/02/2023, 16:50:33 - Kris Stern: Yeah Hrithik Goswami (batman005) Better to try the #jenkinsci_GSoC-Plugin_Health_Score:gitter.im channel
23/02/2023, 16:51:02 - Kris Stern: No problem
23/02/2023, 17:23:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if you are just starting, I encourage you to look at the documentation in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/docs
23/02/2023, 17:26:22 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/193

so I've written a small function to list the scores for the plugins now, but I'm confused as to how to test the function?
like should I write a test and check whether my function works as expected?

I've added it under the ScoreEngine
23/02/2023, 17:28:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so, I would encourage you to look into the PluginRepositoryIT class (in test) or the PluginServiceIT or the ScoreServiceIT classes. 
23/02/2023, 17:29:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): my suggestion is to add manually scores into the database
23/02/2023, 17:30:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): to be fair, the actual deletion shouldn't be in ScoreEngine but ScoreEngine method should call the method which I think should be in ScoreService
23/02/2023, 17:37:12 - Shreya Bhagat: okay. Let me try it out after the jenkins gsoc meet
23/02/2023, 17:43:13 - Jagruti: Well, switching or no is your choice.

But if you are worried about compatibility, let me assure you that I am using Windows 11 too. And the project runs just fine in my system.
23/02/2023, 18:30:22 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): there is no environment requirement. just make sure you have Docker available
23/02/2023, 19:40:19 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I was going through both of the repos. I am not able to understand how the plugin site is using the plugin site api to get the data. On inspecting I can see that the data being fetched is coming from Algolia. Also, the API endpoint according to the URL given is plugins.jenkins.io/ which is also the URL for the frontend of the application. I am very confused
24/02/2023, 05:41:22 - Kris Stern: Awesome Hrithik Goswami (batman005) 
24/02/2023, 11:53:24 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Shreya Bhagat: please note that the pull request template is here to help contributors follow some guidelines

Kris Stern and Jean-March Meessen have been kind enough to suggest edits to my proposal. With their help I have completed all the sections of the proposals except the Implementation and the Timeline section.

You and Dheeraj being the developers, maintainers, and core mentors of the project, I cannot proceed unless you give me your feedback.

You had suggested some suggestions a few days ago, but I do not think you got the chance to go through the whole thing.

Just reminding you to review the proposal when you find time.

25/02/2023, 15:33:46 - Jagruti: Hey Kris Stern 

I understand that the mentors have other responsibilities and commitments outside of open-source. 

I am grateful to everyone taking out their time for me. I'll wait for them to respond when it's convenient to them.🙂

27/02/2023, 13:26:47 - lzeee joined the room
27/02/2023, 15:50:53 - lzeee: Hi, everyone~ I am Shize Gong,  a SDE from China. You can call my Gong. I use Java and Python as my main working language. The idea of Displaying of Plugin Health Scores attracts me. And I'm planing to apply for that project~

Feel sorry for  joining this channel after I have submitted a PR based on an old PR. I should join earlier and discuss how to deal with it.

But now, I'm a little stuck on what should I do before start writing a proposal. There are not many issues labled as beginner-friendly. And any advice will be appreciated!
27/02/2023, 15:57:55 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): contributing to this project is not mandatory to submit a GSoC proposal. If you have other contribution to share, put links in your proposal.
27/02/2023, 15:58:45 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the content of the proposal and your ability to illustrate your strength (other public contribution) are key
27/02/2023, 16:01:57 - lzeee: Ok, thanks for the guide, I think I can make some contributions in other communities.
27/02/2023, 16:02:22 - lzeee: I just read the historical talk in this channel and found them very helpful
27/02/2023, 16:03:32 - lzeee: Thanks again for all the guidance in this channel
27/02/2023, 16:06:43 - lzeee: alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): It occurred to me that there is a detail in the CONTTIBUTING document that is not accurate enough. It took me a long time to understand the version of yarn when setting up the development environment. Can I fine-tune this part of the document?
27/02/2023, 16:08:01 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): at this time in the process, it's better to focus on the proposal than on other contributions. the sooner you can share your proposal the better. 
27/02/2023, 16:08:48 - lzeee: ok, thank you for your advice~
27/02/2023, 16:14:16 - Dheeraj: Thanks for stepping up and welcome to the channel!

> It took me a long time to understand the version of yarn when setting up the development environment

I'm not sure if I understood what you're proposing to add. Because in the guide, the yarn version is clearly mentioned as `Yarn 3.2.4`. Can you elaborate?
27/02/2023, 16:19:06 - lzeee: Hi, I think the version number is a bit confusing for beginners like me, because when you install node.js, it comes with classic Yarn by default, and its version number is something like 1.11.20. In fact, the yarn used in this project refers to yarn berry, which is the second version of yarn. I tried to modify my version for several hours, and found that these are completely two sets of package manager.
27/02/2023, 16:20:42 - lzeee: Of course, for those who already know more about javascript development, this is really not a big problem

28/02/2023, 07:54:02 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) 


Thank you for reviewing the proposal.

I have two questions:

1) 2 of the proposed probes need to be excluded from the proposal. As one is  in-progress, and the other one is already implemented. 

Do you want to me to think of new probes. What else can I do to strengthen my proposal?

2) About the timeline, shall I write how many probes should be delivered each week? Along with scoring and testcases. How should I structure this part? 
28/02/2023, 10:05:57 - Harsh Gupta: Hi, Dhee alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier):    preparing my GSoC proposal for "Displaying Plugin Health Score" I figured out that Jenkins has a plugin site "[plugins.jenkins.io](http://plugins.jenkins.io/)" where we have to display the Health score of the plugin which will be fetched from the project “plugin health score” which you worked on last GSoC 2022.

Jenkins plugin site has it's own backend api repo which is “plugin-site-api” which handles the data for it's frontend. As of my idea till now I have to fetch data from the “plugin health score” DB through “plugin site API” through which data will be displayed in the main plugin site.

I have totally understood the frontend area of the project, facing some difficulties with the backend as I'm not much familiar with the java.

I took reference of Dheeraj:  last year proposal to understand his thought process for this implementation. I just wanted to know, am I going in a right idea path? or I need to change and understand something else
28/02/2023, 10:31:20 - Dheeraj: > As of my idea till now I have to fetch data from the “plugin health score” DB

You do not need to fetch scores from the DB, as there already exists an API, written by Adrien in plugin health score project, which returns the scores of each plugin. You can get the scores from there.
28/02/2023, 10:33:38 - Harsh Gupta: Got it means I have to update plugin site api to do that process and send it to the frontend?
28/02/2023, 10:45:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): for 1., if you have idea, even something that is not clearly defined
28/02/2023, 10:46:32 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): for 2.a. test cases is part of the implementation of the probes (and scoring processes), so they are not done until tested.
28/02/2023, 10:48:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): 2.b. I don't need a probes per week ratio, but how confident you are to deliver X probes in the first part of the GSoC. would you reserve time for maintenance. how do you prioritize implementations. etc. 
28/02/2023, 10:50:01 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): but also if you have moments (days or weeks) when you already know that you won't be available. again, this is not to control you, just so we are clear about time off. I won't be available for the 12weeks as I will take time off as well (but don't worry, someone will be there to mentor when I'm off)
28/02/2023, 11:08:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): or you can argue in your proposal that this is not needed and the `plugin-site` project (reactjs) can reach directly the api of the plugin-health-scoring project to display the scores
28/02/2023, 11:33:03 - Dheeraj: I'm sorry but I'm not sure what to suggest you here. For me, this didn't seem like a major problem...

> I tried to modify my version for several hours, and found that these are completely two sets of package manager.

were you able to finally get it working? if yes, then how?
28/02/2023, 12:02:31 - Anshuman Shukla joined the room
28/02/2023, 12:24:11 - Harsh Gupta: Thanks Dheeraj and Adrien🙂
28/02/2023, 12:25:23 - Dheeraj: you're welcome!
28/02/2023, 13:01:11 - lzeee: yes it's working correctly.
28/02/2023, 13:01:52 - lzeee: In my opinion, it would be better to emphasize yarn berry or the second edition
28/02/2023, 15:00:46 - Jagruti: Thank you. I will add the all the points you have mentioned to the proposal. 
28/02/2023, 15:41:05 - Dheeraj: I'm curious to know what alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) thinks about this.
28/02/2023, 16:54:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): to be fair, the version is specified on the contributing guide but knowing how to install that tool is not on the project responsibility imo. you can find resources online to guide you on how to install each tools. 
28/02/2023, 16:54:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it would be the same for Maven. The version is stated on the contributing guide, not how to install it.
