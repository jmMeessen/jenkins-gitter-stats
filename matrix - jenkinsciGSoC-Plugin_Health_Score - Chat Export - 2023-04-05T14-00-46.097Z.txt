08/06/2022, 11:00:38 - Dheeraj: The voting code for the mentimeter survey expired but got regenerated again (and it's still the same as the previous one lol). I tried to take the survey and it's still up.

If needed, we can also make the audience rate the question relative to one another, as suggested by Jake yesterday. So, we can explore the mentimeter survey if we aren't able to find any other alternative.
08/06/2022, 11:14:18 - kuro joined the room
08/06/2022, 11:31:19 - jleon33 (jleon33): jleon33 :) 
08/06/2022, 11:32:12 - jleon33 (jleon33): that sounds great. I will explore that deeper today 
08/06/2022, 11:38:54 - kuro: Hello everyone, 
Sorry for being away for the last week. There were a lot of things going on simultaneously + had to travel with family (sort of an emergency). I am back now and catching up on messages. Yet to have a look at 2 documents shared by Dheeraj.

Regarding the survey, not sure if this was already considered --> [ahaslides](https://ahaslides.com/blog/free-alternative-to-mentimeter/), it has similar sliders like mentimeter, I did not find an expiry time limit. 
08/06/2022, 11:50:34 - Dheeraj: ahah that's embarassing, sorry I'm dumb enough to not click on your profile 
09/06/2022, 11:04:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @jleon33 I created 2 milestones in GitHub, for each phase of the GSoC. I feel like this would ease our evaluations of the internship. I propose that we start laying down some expectations for Dheeraj in those milestone so that he can star coding knowing what we as looking for. Does this make sense @adi10hero:matrix.org ?
09/06/2022, 11:04:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): milestones are here: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/milestones
09/06/2022, 14:49:39 - Dheeraj: Hi, is it possible to have a quick meeting before the GSoC Office hours today?

I had some questions regarding the topics we discussed during our previous meeting.
I know we have a scheduled meeting tomorrow but I was hoping to spend that for planning the Coding Phase with the minimal questions on the Architecture diagram and stuff.

Having said that, it's totally fine if we're not able to get on a call before today's office hours, we can discuss them tomorrow as well.
09/06/2022, 15:25:03 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): what do you want to discuss? the architecture diagram?
09/06/2022, 15:26:59 - Dheeraj: Yes, small clarifying questions on that. You've already explained most of them previously but I thought about them again after the meeting and wanted to make sure I got them right...

It's fine if you're not free, no rush at all
09/06/2022, 15:27:37 - Dheeraj: I see, you can also answer them on meeting notes, that's even better
09/06/2022, 15:36:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): let's have a call because I don't understand the "Why wouldn’t current architecture support a self-hosted service
"
09/06/2022, 15:36:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): https://meet.google.com/xxs-tonw-cpc
09/06/2022, 15:39:49 - Dheeraj: joining
09/06/2022, 16:07:16 - jleon33 (jleon33): I think that makes sense, thanks Adrien. I am tied up most of today with the Jenkins Contributor Summit and traveling. 
09/06/2022, 17:58:35 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Was about to use PHS for "Plugin Health Scoring" but in the US it means "Public Health System" 
09/06/2022, 18:09:12 - jleon33 (jleon33): we have a public health system??? :troll:
09/06/2022, 18:22:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I didn't want to make that joke but I admit I thought about it 😉 
10/06/2022, 20:01:59 - Dheeraj: do we need to implement REST APIs as well? which would act as middlemen between the "data fetch from Update Center" and our "DB".
10/06/2022, 20:16:22 - Dheeraj: OR, if my understanding is correct:
we'd prefer to use a service class (with an autowired repository) that would implement the flow of data between the Update center and the DB? something like that
10/06/2022, 21:46:27 - jleon33 (jleon33): thats a great question. I am not sure which one would be optimal.
11/06/2022, 04:23:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): rest API would be for a UI or a human to interact with our system. I don't see a need for it. 
11/06/2022, 08:10:33 - Dheeraj: sure, makes sense. thanks, Jake and Adrien!
13/06/2022, 14:55:30 - jleon33 (jleon33): been looking into ahaslides, looks like the free version only allows for 7 participants unfortunately. 
13/06/2022, 16:39:58 - kuro: <@jleon33-6242f62c6da0373984936088:gitter.im "been looking into ahaslides, loo..."> I think it's 7 participants at a time, and if completes, others can vote, but will have to check :/ 
Mentimeter does look like a good choice  
13/06/2022, 16:44:27 - kuro: <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "@jleon33 I created 2 milestones ..."> Yes alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier). Milestones and tickets added to those milestones helped me (and possibly my mentors) a lot to track progress :) 
13/06/2022, 21:01:06 - Dheeraj: ####Daily Update (June 13, 2022)
* What I worked on:
> Setup the Spring Boot project, read Update Center's JSON object and store relevant info ('name', 'scm', and 'releaseTimestamp') into the PostgreSQL database.

* What I'll be working on next:
> Make the current code presentable (currently, it's very hacky) and create a PR to start review.

* Any blockers?
> Nothing so far.

14/06/2022, 06:36:33 - Dheeraj: @jleon33 if possible, can you please share the meeting recording for June 10?
14/06/2022, 14:31:28 - Dheeraj: I'll be 5mins late sorry. Previous meeting got extended.
14/06/2022, 14:31:36 - jleon33 (jleon33): no worries, i will share that recording!
14/06/2022, 14:32:58 - jleon33 (jleon33): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zgTl3WWycyakCa4jv19TDndLrXI89QKR/view?usp=sharing (june 10 recording)
14/06/2022, 16:51:08 - Dheeraj: Thanks!
14/06/2022, 17:30:01 - Dheeraj: Just putting it out here if we've not shared it before, this is the doc where we record our Meeting notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZr527mYmEYmGy00RaDEbi1bi1gpdVR13031KSi_NmM/edit#
It also contains the required links and documents useful to this project.

14/06/2022, 22:44:11 - Dheeraj: ####Daily Update (June 14, 2022)
* What I worked on:
> Briefly read about logging (didn't understand much, will read more on it)
> Created an issue under Milestone 1 (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/2)
> Cleaned up the code and created a PR (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/3)

* What I'll be working on next:
> As discussed with Jake, it would make sense to work on implementing some methods which run a handful of probes on the plugins and store the results inside the DB.

* Any blockers?
> Nothing so far.
15/06/2022, 13:55:11 - jleon33 (jleon33): Shared a Google form with you all, an attempt at a short survey for getting the communities input on probes and their importance
15/06/2022, 13:56:19 - jleon33 (jleon33): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FIlhpQheLA-gMUNbwnNJlJRiKA3Xj_lOQgYhcwvjcY0/edit
15/06/2022, 15:40:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha I reviewed your first PR. Please see my comments / suggestions. I also created what could be your next task.
15/06/2022, 15:41:16 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much Adrien, I'll look at it now.
15/06/2022, 15:48:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @jleon33 I created https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/projects/1 so we can see what's going on in the project. If we create tasks for Dheeraj to work on (our job), we only need to monitor this and the daily update from Dheeraj (thank you for those!) can be limited to "Any blockers" 
15/06/2022, 15:50:39 - Dheeraj: Thank you Jake!
I'm not an expert to comment on the data but to me, it does look very neat, precise, and short. As a community member, I wouldn't cry while taking the survey for sure.
15/06/2022, 15:54:30 - jleon33 (jleon33): thanks for taking a look dheeraj. I am trying to think of how to make the multiple choice more enlightening. I have a sense that it wouldnt tell us much right now
15/06/2022, 16:31:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): To be fair, this is a good start. You could have split the work into "PR-1: application setup (aka import from spring-boot)" and "PR-2: read update-center and create models" and "PR-3: insert into database". 
15/06/2022, 16:32:07 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): but this is fine. 
15/06/2022, 16:42:14 - jleon33 (jleon33): awesome, thank you so much adrien! 
15/06/2022, 17:02:54 - Dheeraj: Are you talking about the wordings? "somewhat", "pretty", "really", "definitely"
15/06/2022, 17:04:37 - Dheeraj: ohh 😟 that sounds much better because there's a lot going on in that PR I agree.
15/06/2022, 18:07:12 - jleon33 (jleon33): the wording, the amount of options there are, etc. Should we just do like
1 - not important at all 
2 
3
4 - somewhat important
5 
6
7 - really important
8
9
10 - extremely important
15/06/2022, 18:27:59 - Dheeraj: umm don't know, can you try to create a question with these options? because I tried this in your survey form by choosing "Linear Scale" but it doesn't let me label intermediate scales, only the left, and right extremes scales can be labeled.
15/06/2022, 18:28:57 - jleon33 (jleon33): I would just do it with multiple choice. let me change it
15/06/2022, 18:30:38 - jleon33 (jleon33): first ranking question should show it now
15/06/2022, 18:39:30 - Dheeraj: oh nice. we would need everyone's opinion on this.
as per me, this doesn't put much strain on me to choose one of the 4 options as it was earlier ("somewhat", "pretty", "really", "definitely")

I can always take a middle road between "Really important" and "extremely important" by choosing a scale of 8 or 9. Not that the earlier 4 options were an inconvenience, they were nice but I find these new ones nicer.
15/06/2022, 18:46:50 - Dheeraj: @alecharp how do I add some maven commands ("mvn tidy:pom", in this case) into a specific phase ("validate" in this case)? in order to run them as part of that phase.

i tried to google but keep on finding blogs and videos describing what are maven's lifecycle phase
15/06/2022, 18:58:36 - jleon33 (jleon33): yah i find this a bit nicer and we can gather at least a little bit more information with more options. 
15/06/2022, 18:59:01 - jleon33 (jleon33): will wait for Adrien and Aditya's opinion
15/06/2022, 19:05:02 - Dheeraj: Also, was it a good choice to use these Service, Controller, and Repository annotations? we can always edit/update/revert things, no big deal
15/06/2022, 19:23:17 - kuro: <@jleon33-6242f62c6da0373984936088:gitter.im "will wait for Adrien and Aditya'..."> Hello Team, even I think the scale of 1-10 is better than just the 4 options.

15/06/2022, 20:17:12 - kuro: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "@alecharp how do I add some mave..."> Hi dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha), I have added a snippet as a reply to alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier)'s comment in github. It think it'll help you make the required changes.
15/06/2022, 20:42:36 - Dheeraj: This is very helpful @adi10hero:matrix.org!
16/06/2022, 19:42:07 - Dheeraj: Hi team,
I think I might not be able to work (with the current pace) for the first few days of the next week starting June 20 onwards(Mon, Tues, Wed, and Thurs).
16/06/2022, 19:43:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): more generally, some plugins have goal tied to a maven phase. So, when you say you want to use a plugin, that goal would be automatically executed when you call the phase of Maven (`clean`, `compile`, `test`, etc.). Here, you have to specify this in the `executions` section of the plugin configuration. 
16/06/2022, 19:44:14 - Dheeraj: My proposal got selected for an internal Red Hat Event, and the main date is June 23 (Thurs). Since this is my first time speaking at a conf, I need to prepare a little bit on the content and speaking skills.
16/06/2022, 19:44:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): As you went we Springframework, it's a good choice. Same for the interface you implemented for the repository.
16/06/2022, 19:45:47 - Dheeraj: I'm sorry, I should have told you about this earlier but I thought I'll manage but now I'm a little nervous haha
16/06/2022, 19:45:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes. in the future, try to limit the scope of the PR so that the review is easier for you and us.
16/06/2022, 19:46:59 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): This is fine. Good luck with your presentation. 
16/06/2022, 19:47:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Please let us know in the future if you have other engagement like that. 
16/06/2022, 19:48:03 - Dheeraj: As per the deliverables are concerned, I think we're on a good pace. I'll work on the currently open PR. when that gets merged we'd have a way to fetch data from Update center, and push that data into DB.
The next part would be to work on the docker compose aspect of the project and the analysis part of the probes. I'll manage to cover up for the time lost in those 4 days, during the next weekend for sure...
16/06/2022, 19:49:51 - Dheeraj: sure, thanks for your time and patience.
16/06/2022, 19:51:54 - Dheeraj: Good to know!
16/06/2022, 20:03:55 - Dheeraj: Thank you!
Yes sure, I'll inform the team in advance next time.
16/06/2022, 20:05:06 - Dheeraj: Makes much more sense. I have noted this down. Thanks for the detailed explanation!
20/06/2022, 13:50:20 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @adi10hero:matrix.org from your past experience, should we wait for Dheeraj to have time to attend the PR or should I go ahead and fix the PR so that Dheeraj can start working on the next steps? I fear that we are going we waist time
20/06/2022, 14:16:32 - kuro: <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "@adi10hero:matrix.org from your ..."> From my experience if it is some config thing or just standard project setup fix then we can go ahead and make the fix and tell Dheeraj to have a look. If the changes are specific to some learning like use of a service/writing tests/design patterns then waiting for Dheeraj to work on it would be worth it :) 
20/06/2022, 14:21:25 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): because of the content of the PR, it's a bit of both. let's wait then
20/06/2022, 14:21:29 - kuro: <@adi10hero:matrix.org "From my experience if it is some..."> I remember my 1st PR taking a lot of time and Kristin suggesting me to change the core logic itself and use standard design pattern XD
But it helped me (and other contributors) in the long run to write code 
20/06/2022, 14:22:40 - kuro: <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "because of the content of the PR..."> Yes, I agree 
20/06/2022, 14:22:42 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it's about license header, proper (java) package to use, a few configuration in the POM 
20/06/2022, 14:22:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so yeah, a few things to learn about that.
20/06/2022, 18:22:30 - Dheeraj: sounds great, thanks! I'm on it.
20/06/2022, 18:26:28 - Dheeraj: @alecharp what do you think about marking the GitHub conversations as resolved? if you feel that I've addressed your comments/suggestions. As I don't feel it's right for me to mark them as resolved when I have not used the best approach for your suggestion.
20/06/2022, 18:27:05 - Dheeraj: Just trying to know what would be the best practice to follow here
21/06/2022, 11:20:35 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I prefer if you don't resolve them (mine or anyone else) so that you don't close the discussion. if your answer is good, then we can close it, but if there is mistake or misunderstanding, it's better to keep it open.
21/06/2022, 11:56:38 - Dheeraj: Makes sense :thumbsup: 
21/06/2022, 16:43:44 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha I merged the PR
21/06/2022, 17:51:45 - Dheeraj: Yayyy!!  💥   \ (^_^) /
21/06/2022, 17:52:35 - jleon33 (jleon33): :thumbsup: 
21/06/2022, 19:06:09 - kuro: Congratulations dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha).  You'll remember this PR for a long time haha :P 
21/06/2022, 19:08:50 - kuro: I have been getting stuck in work meetings during the weekly sync up from the last two weeks now. If it is okay with everyone, can we postpone the meeting by a couple of hours? Or at least an hr?
I propose: Tuesdays 2 or 2:30 UTC 
21/06/2022, 19:24:22 - Dheeraj: Thanks! Yes, I bet 😌
21/06/2022, 19:28:54 - Dheeraj: No objections from my side to the proposed timing ^
21/06/2022, 19:29:16 - Dheeraj: @jleon33 can you please share the meeting recording?
21/06/2022, 20:11:09 - jleon33 (jleon33): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1frk7BKqwmtl21igh1LiVS6V1ql6sSctA/view?usp=sharing
21/06/2022, 20:11:16 - jleon33 (jleon33): here you are @dheerajodha 
21/06/2022, 20:28:10 - Dheeraj: Thanks!!
21/06/2022, 21:56:40 - Dheeraj: I think I was able to successfully Dockerize the application. I have just submitted a PR for the same, here: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/7
22/06/2022, 07:28:16 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm sure you have seen this already, but I posted a lot of comment on the PR. 
22/06/2022, 08:11:54 - Dheeraj: Yes, I saw it. I would be lying if I say that I didn't see these many comments coming 😆 because I pushed the PR a little too quickly (compared to the previous one).
22/06/2022, 08:15:10 - Dheeraj: I'll try to work on the review comments in between. I can totally see that they'll teach me the right way of doing things, which is exactly what I wanted to learn.

So, thank you to you and Aditya for your time and efforts!!
22/06/2022, 14:04:56 - jleon33 (jleon33): If you two are ok with the later time, I am sure Adrien and I can work with that
22/06/2022, 14:05:22 - jleon33 (jleon33): we can also look at a different day if that works better
22/06/2022, 14:26:31 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please let me know if anything is unclear. I tried to put links to documentation for most of the issues
22/06/2022, 14:48:24 - Dheeraj: noted. so @adi10hero:matrix.org, would the current timing work for you on some other day?

or you'd like to stick to pushing the timing ahead for the meetings on tuesday?
22/06/2022, 14:50:53 - Dheeraj: sure, I'm yet to go over the comments in detail but thanks for attaching the links.

I'll prepare for the presentation now and get back to the review comments asap (~18 hrs from now)
22/06/2022, 15:02:08 - Jmm: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha): Ping me here if you have difficulties to join the meeting
22/06/2022, 16:12:45 - kuro: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "noted. so @adi10hero:matrix.org,..."> Hey dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) , any day is fine with me but the timing is becoming an issue as sometimes meetings get extended or scheduled post 6 pm IST (negative side effect of work from home). Having it an hour or two later (on any day) is what I would request.

PS: If it's becoming an inconvenience then no worries we can keep the same. I would try my best to join and we can have async or adhoc discussions if required 
22/06/2022, 16:28:44 - jleon33 (jleon33): So if i push back the meeting to 10 am ET, does that work for everyone?
22/06/2022, 20:03:45 - Dheeraj: works for me
22/06/2022, 20:52:22 - Dheeraj: Thanks for setting up the meeting!
24/06/2022, 15:21:35 - jleon33 (jleon33): @dheerajodha @adi10hero:matrix.org @alecharp  are we happy with the current survey? Should we blast it out to the wider Jenkins community? 
24/06/2022, 15:22:40 - jleon33 (jleon33): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FIlhpQheLA-gMUNbwnNJlJRiKA3Xj_lOQgYhcwvjcY0/edit
24/06/2022, 16:30:58 - Dheeraj: I think this looks good :thumbsup: 
Sure, we can pass it on to the wider Jenkins community if everyone else agrees as well.
24/06/2022, 16:52:39 - kuro: <@jleon33-6242f62c6da0373984936088:gitter.im "@dheerajodha @adi10hero:matrix.o..."> Yes jleon33 (jleon33)  I too think we can.. 
24/06/2022, 18:33:45 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha is there any blocking issue on the PR review I gave you?
24/06/2022, 19:41:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha I have some corrections I'd like to explain, so if we could schedule a quick call, that would be great.
24/06/2022, 19:59:21 - Dheeraj: Yes please, when are you free?
24/06/2022, 19:59:35 - Dheeraj: @alecharp I think I've addressed all your comments and currently working on the last one: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/7#discussion_r903041480

I'll push the changes asap
24/06/2022, 20:09:40 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): now
24/06/2022, 20:09:55 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): meet.google.com/pvb-qdjt-hkk
24/06/2022, 20:10:01 - Dheeraj: coming
24/06/2022, 20:10:31 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): thank you very much
24/06/2022, 20:11:40 - Dheeraj: My pleasure!
24/06/2022, 20:44:32 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): editorConfig: https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig
24/06/2022, 20:47:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): PostgreSQL Docker Image details: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
24/06/2022, 21:03:27 - jleon33 (jleon33): Ok we can blast it out to the devlist if we think thats the best way to communicate it. Now, who would like to blast it out? I dont mind doing it but it may get better traction from someone with a little bit more credibility in the community. 
27/06/2022, 13:57:36 - Dheeraj: @alecharp regarding: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/6

During our last meeting, everything made sense to me. I remember deleting PluginController, and shifting readUpdateCenter() method from PluginService to a new UpdateCenterService file. UpdateCenterService file included 2 `record`s which were parsing the JSON object and only fetching the "plugin" map (Map<String, PluginRecord>) where PluginRecord I think looked like this: PluginRecord(String name, String scm, ZonedDateTime releaseTimestamp).

Now, I'm trying to recall the alternative to the XSLT type of query, is it ok to ask you for any links on that?
27/06/2022, 14:48:22 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this is not related to the containerization of the application
27/06/2022, 14:48:32 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please do not include this in the current PR
27/06/2022, 14:51:09 - Dheeraj: sure, I was working on it (in a separate branch) while I took some break from the containerization PR since it was giving that weird error. But now, I'll just stick to the current PR.
27/06/2022, 14:55:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes please stick to one pull requet at a time. 
27/06/2022, 14:59:05 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha about your latest comment:
 1. you can use any SQL client (I use the one in my IntelliJ) to query the database
 2. please make sure to use Docker Compose v2 and not `docker-compose`.
 3. most important: please make sure to understand all the commits I pushed to your branch, this is the most important thing here.
27/06/2022, 14:59:53 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): having the project to work because I pushed some commit is one thing, understanding why and what I pushed if even more important. 
27/06/2022, 15:38:31 - Dheeraj: 1. wow, a game-changer for me.
2. noted.
3. Sure, I definitely have some doubts regarding those commits you did. Currently, I'm trying to understand them in-between. Will get back to you with questions soon.

Yes, I totally understand your point.
27/06/2022, 15:53:33 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please let me know if you need / have time for a quick call so I can answer those questions / doubt
27/06/2022, 15:55:52 - Dheeraj: sure, ill text here
27/06/2022, 16:47:31 - Dheeraj: @alecharp are you free for a quick call now?
27/06/2022, 16:51:16 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes

27/06/2022, 16:53:08 - Dheeraj: joining in 2 mins
27/06/2022, 17:36:46 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): answer to root question: let Jackson do the unmarshalling of the JSON to the Records that you will be writting
27/06/2022, 19:35:56 - Dheeraj: sure, thanks!
27/06/2022, 22:28:29 - jleon33 (jleon33): @alecharp and I have a conflict that just arose for our call tomorrow. Anyone opposed if I push it a half hour earlier for 30 minutes? 
28/06/2022, 07:59:52 - Dheeraj: Works for me :thumbsup: 
28/06/2022, 10:08:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): sorry, our conflict was just moved to thrusday, so no conflict for today
28/06/2022, 11:33:48 - Dheeraj: great
28/06/2022, 11:35:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha the PR is merged. Congratulations!
28/06/2022, 11:39:03 - Dheeraj: @alecharp yes, thank you!! ^_^
28/06/2022, 13:25:53 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/11 this is where the fun begins.

28/06/2022, 16:52:35 - jleon33 (jleon33): I will get the recording link in our working notes as soon as its processed
28/06/2022, 17:01:48 - Dheeraj: awesome, thanks!
28/06/2022, 17:16:53 - Dheeraj: how much ~ time would a person need to spend in order to take this survey?
28/06/2022, 17:16:56 - Dheeraj: 2 mins?
28/06/2022, 17:19:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): say 5
28/06/2022, 17:19:48 - Dheeraj: ok
28/06/2022, 17:23:24 - Dheeraj: i have sent a test email to 4 of us, can you please check the subject, and body if anything needs correction
28/06/2022, 17:25:23 - Dheeraj: i might be thinking too much but just to confirm that by using "Hello Jenkins Contributors!" we're already referring to maintainers too, right? so ill keep it as it is
28/06/2022, 17:31:47 - jleon33 (jleon33): Looks great to me @dheerajodha 
28/06/2022, 17:47:49 - Dheeraj: cool, i'll send it out now then
28/06/2022, 19:42:46 - Dheeraj: i had to postpone the email, currently waiting for the final inputs in the "test run" email thread
29/06/2022, 09:19:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha please make sure you update your local clone before creating a new branch. I cannot review the PR you submitted because it's not correct.
29/06/2022, 09:22:10 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): your work is not lost. You can create a local tag with the current HEAD `git tag do-not-forget` and then run `git checkout main && git pull --rebase --prune && git checkout feature-mapping-required-fields && git reset --hard main`. At this step, the branch `feature-mapping-required-fields` would be at the same state as the `main` branch. Then you can cherry pick the commits you created specifically for this work.
29/06/2022, 10:54:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha please review https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/10 before going back to the PR you need to re-create. This PR changes a lot of things.
29/06/2022, 12:05:59 - Dheeraj: Thank you for taking the time and writing the commands, it's very helpful.
I'll work on this in the evening asap.
29/06/2022, 12:06:59 - Dheeraj: By "review" do you mean checking your commits and understanding them?
29/06/2022, 14:02:00 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes, and once you have answers to all your questions, approve it.
29/06/2022, 15:56:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please wait for the CI pull to be merge. 
29/06/2022, 19:27:10 - Dheeraj: ok sure
29/06/2022, 19:27:33 - Dheeraj: sure!
29/06/2022, 20:30:24 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if my responses satisfy your questions, please resolve the conversations
29/06/2022, 20:35:54 - Dheeraj: okay sure
29/06/2022, 22:22:33 - Dheeraj: I'm still seeing the formatting issues in the PR. in my VS Code IDE i see them fine but now that i pushed it, it looks jumbled up 😟
i tried to shift to IntelliJ but got some package errors and then i couldn't find time to solve those, so ill shift to IntelliJ soon in future. in the meantime, please excuse the formatting errors...
30/06/2022, 09:19:48 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): there is no problem we cannot fix
30/06/2022, 10:25:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha Wadeck is asking a good question for the survey, do you want to answer or should I?
30/06/2022, 12:57:37 - Dheeraj: @alecharp Can you answer it please?
I'm a little confused, I think he's asking for the probe values of each plugins, which is something we are yet to achieve. And the two goals he talks about, our current weight-based approach already takes it into account.

But please go ahead an drop a reply, I'll understand it better.
30/06/2022, 13:00:52 - Dheeraj: exactly, I will fix it but yesterday I had a time-bandwidth issue. I'll try to work on the formatting today or try switching to intellij
30/06/2022, 13:08:04 - Dheeraj: Because if I use his example, after our project is ready and weights are decided:

If all plugins have a code coverage of 50%+, it's probe value (after applying weight) would be more than those which have a code coverage of 5%.

Based on the scores, we can see the current situation like: 90% of plugins have probe score more than 70/100, which "shows the current situation".
And out of those 10% plugins let's say 7 of them has a score 25/100, so this "provides guidance about what to improve on a plugin,"

But I think I might be misunderstanding him here.
30/06/2022, 15:19:01 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): no I don't think you misunderstood. 
30/06/2022, 18:40:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha are you around / available for a quick chat? 
30/06/2022, 18:41:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I know / understand it's already late for you so it's not a problem if you cannot
30/06/2022, 18:47:26 - Dheeraj: yes I am, no problem at all

01/07/2022, 13:07:20 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Thank you @dheerajodha. I merge the PR. I submitted a new one for you to review, just about CI fix. Please approve it asap. Then, please look at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/16
01/07/2022, 13:22:32 - Dheeraj: Thank you! Sure, I'm on it.
01/07/2022, 17:04:24 - Dheeraj: hi @alecharp, i have doubts regarding the new issue where you just commented. I don't understand it. Can we have a quick call?
01/07/2022, 17:51:37 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): sure
01/07/2022, 17:52:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): still around?
01/07/2022, 18:07:44 - Dheeraj: Just finished dinner. whenever you're ready
01/07/2022, 18:10:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): https://meet.google.com/rkx-qhqm-nnc
01/07/2022, 18:11:28 - Dheeraj: joining 
05/07/2022, 10:44:44 - Dheeraj: hi team, sorry I've taken a sick leave today.
if you don't mind can we please shift our weekly meeting from today (Tuesday) to tomorrow or any later days (Thurs, Fri) at the same time?
05/07/2022, 10:48:07 - kuro: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "hi team, sorry I've taken a sick..."> Fine by me. Please take care dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha)
05/07/2022, 15:52:42 - jleon33 (jleon33): Indeed, take care dheeraj, I will move it to later this week!
05/07/2022, 15:53:45 - jleon33 (jleon33): moved to thursday :) - take care
05/07/2022, 15:54:20 - Dheeraj: thank you very much ^_^
05/07/2022, 20:47:24 - jleon33 (jleon33): Following up on Wadeck's initial feedback, what would be the best way for me to gather some data points like JEP-229 adoption, who has CI implemented, code coverage for each plugin, etc.? 
05/07/2022, 20:57:50 - jleon33 (jleon33): Survey update: 5 responses
06/07/2022, 16:54:46 - Dheeraj: I'm not sure I understood. How can I take a look at his feedback?

Are you asking this from a technical perspective, like for a given plugin, how would you find if it has, say, CI in place or not?
06/07/2022, 16:57:09 - jleon33 (jleon33): Yes I am thinking practically. What is the best way to query the plugin base to get these sets of information. For example, of the 1800+ plugins, 42% of them have code coverage of 75% or higher. Of the top 200 (most used) plugins, 175 of them have adopted JEP-229. etc etc
06/07/2022, 16:57:37 - jleon33 (jleon33): thats really what wadecks initial feedback in his response email to the survey was getting at
06/07/2022, 22:31:26 - jleon33 (jleon33): Something Basil Crow shared with me today was this tool https://github.com/sghill/rewrite-jenkins - might be worth looking into
11/07/2022, 23:20:10 - jleon33 (jleon33): up to 9 responses on the survey
12/07/2022, 11:04:46 - Jmm: Go Survey, GO !
12/07/2022, 14:06:02 - Dheeraj: nice!
13/07/2022, 11:31:51 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha I just pushed a few commits in the first PR. Please note that we now have reports to check on https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Infra/job/plugin-health-scoring/ (checkstyle but also spotbugs)
13/07/2022, 15:34:25 - Dheeraj: Yes, I went through your commits. At first, it didn't make sense to me why you did them but then I looked at the spotbugs report.
Thanks for the reminder, I just kept checking the Checkstyle reports. I'll now also start checking spotbugs too.
14/07/2022, 15:40:07 - Dheeraj: @alecharp there'll be some delay in the current PR as I'm learning about writing tests using the link you shared and with trial and error. My initial aim was to push all the required commits for it before our GSoC office hours but I don't see that happening. I hope you won't mind...
14/07/2022, 19:23:11 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): ok, but this is kind of blocking all the rest. probe engine included.
15/07/2022, 13:05:02 - Dheeraj: oh, ill work on it asap now.
17/07/2022, 00:30:45 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny) joined the room
17/07/2022, 00:41:40 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny): Nice project! This could replace the current tracker of documentation migration https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/progress 
17/07/2022, 15:13:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): not exactly, as we wouldn't have a single page to list that kind of effort. But each plugin page would have a "Is the wiki page transferred?" kind of marker and it would for sure impact the grad of the plugin.
17/07/2022, 20:29:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I fixed the test configuration and provided you with a test which proves that the code is still not fixed.
18/07/2022, 11:27:11 - Dheeraj: Big help. Yes, I saw test failure locally so I'm working on a fix now.
18/07/2022, 13:05:12 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): great.
18/07/2022, 13:05:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you should look at the javadoc of the Optional.orElse
18/07/2022, 13:05:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and the javadoc of Optional.orElseGet, could be helpful
18/07/2022, 13:49:12 - Dheeraj: Thanks for the hint, reading it now.
18/07/2022, 15:22:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha you can "rebase" the PR-18 on top of the new head of the main branch, so that you have the fixed checkstyle configuration and the fixed main class of the application (required for the tests I pushed on PR-18)
18/07/2022, 15:23:10 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): or you can merge `main` into PR-18
18/07/2022, 15:23:25 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): with `rebase`, you will have to force-push. which my not be great.
18/07/2022, 15:44:19 - Dheeraj: okay, on it.
18/07/2022, 16:12:51 - Dheeraj: I merged `main` to PR-18 and now the tests passed. Can you please take a look?
18/07/2022, 16:21:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): looking. It seems that you rebase and merge.
18/07/2022, 16:24:16 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it should have been on or the other
18/07/2022, 16:24:38 - Dheeraj: uh yes 😕 ...I did it from IDE and then still had merge conflicts (was shown on PR) and then fixed conflicts vi GitHub UI.
18/07/2022, 16:25:21 - Dheeraj: but it got the right changes, right?
18/07/2022, 16:44:23 - Dheeraj: I see that I've made mistake while doing this. I'm really sorry for the time you have to spend on this.
18/07/2022, 16:52:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): no problem.
18/07/2022, 16:52:24 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please look at https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Infra/job/plugin-health-scoring/view/change-requests/job/PR-18/11/spotbugs/fileName.1524004919/
18/07/2022, 16:56:15 - Dheeraj: sure, on it.
18/07/2022, 17:53:56 - Dheeraj: I was just wondering what you think about this: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/18#discussion_r923528629 ?
18/07/2022, 18:19:05 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha for your next task, you can look at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/9
18/07/2022, 20:38:22 - Dheeraj: Okay sure!
18/07/2022, 21:46:41 - Dheeraj: Hi @zbynek o/

Thank you :-)
19/07/2022, 16:51:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/
20/07/2022, 20:53:44 - jleon33 (jleon33): up to 20 on the survey. @dheerajodha do you need any help on the presentation for tomorrow?
20/07/2022, 21:29:08 - Dheeraj: Thanks for asking @jleon33!
I'm yet to write content for the presentation (check here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HX06i64pDIkkENzrr3yWG10BbnoHIJOnhnJDRH3EZpg/edit#slide=id.g7f320445dc_7_78).

I'll complete making the slides within the next 16 hours, and then can you please review them? I tend to put in extra info in the slides most of the time, so if needed, maybe you can trim it down a bit so that it fits the 15 mins slot that we'd have. wdyt?
20/07/2022, 21:48:18 - Dheeraj: It's not something urgent, so it's fine if we don't review the slides because I already discussed the contents with you and Adrien yesterday in our meeting.
20/07/2022, 22:05:58 - jleon33 (jleon33): that works for me, I just requested access. I will review them, im sure they are great
21/07/2022, 09:22:58 - Dheeraj: @alecharp I switched to the main branch (since I'll be showing the demo from this branch), then ran "mvn package -DskipTests", then ran "docker compose up", then using the SQL client I have in my IDE, I ran "select * from plugins;" and the result doesn't show the "details" column.

I tried to delete the jar and regenerate it using the mvn package command but still "details" column isn't visible in the select statement's output.

When I do git pull, it says "Already up to date.", what am I missing?
21/07/2022, 10:02:48 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): is your local `main` branch in sync with the repository `jenkins-infra` or with your fork?
21/07/2022, 10:08:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please ping me so we can have a call
21/07/2022, 10:15:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I have the same behavior. looking into it.
21/07/2022, 10:18:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): easy mistake: you need to build the image for the `app` service. You can do `docker compose up --build` to do that. I would first do a `docker compose down -v` to make sure to clean up the db content. 
21/07/2022, 10:25:29 - Dheeraj: That makes so much sense, I'll keep that in mind.
Works for me now, thanks
21/07/2022, 11:55:55 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheeraj do you plan to add some content on the slides you have?
21/07/2022, 11:59:51 - Dheeraj: I do
21/07/2022, 12:00:49 - Dheeraj: I'm right now planning for the demo and the list of things I'll be explaining (see speaker note of Slide 4 please and correct me if I'm missing anything)
21/07/2022, 12:23:39 - Dheeraj: @alecharp Out of curiosity: was there any need to override this Port variable? https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/compose.yml#L10
Because we already have it in the ".env" file where the value is the same (5432), so it can anyways read it from there directly.
21/07/2022, 12:24:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes. 
21/07/2022, 12:24:47 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the postgresql image is not allowing to change the port on which the DB is listening. 
21/07/2022, 12:25:10 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so it's always `5432` in the compose network
21/07/2022, 12:26:00 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): however, we are publishing this port here (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/compose.yml#L28) to have access to the DB outside of the compose network
21/07/2022, 12:26:32 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): (when we run the DB from docker compose and the application from CLI or IDE for example)
21/07/2022, 12:27:09 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): but when we run everything from docker compose, it's better not to get out of the network and use the published port of the db service
21/07/2022, 13:16:40 - Dheeraj: I see, understood. thanks!
21/07/2022, 13:45:54 - Dheeraj: FYI: I'd need to transfer our slides to this common presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t2vuNn1NFpDusnw0m4vdFw6WBQMeU6kccv_K1v2L6R0/edit#slide=id.g13dcaed2105_0_0

I'll do that soon.
21/07/2022, 16:21:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): let run the presentation among us before the live demo: https://meet.google.com/kwk-ioxb-mfd
21/07/2022, 17:36:53 - jleon33 (jleon33): great job dheeraj
21/07/2022, 17:37:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): very good presentation @dheeraj ! congrats
21/07/2022, 17:47:11 - Dheeraj: Thank youu :see_no_evil:, the last meeting we had was super helpful :raised_hands: !
21/07/2022, 18:17:34 - Jmm: Very good presentation dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) 
Exciting things that were done and still to work and contribute. 👏
21/07/2022, 18:19:18 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much @jmMeessen :D
Biggest thanks to my mentors for the constant support throughout!!
21/07/2022, 18:25:24 - Jmm: This is the essence of GSoC and Community. Looking forward for the next steps.
22/07/2022, 16:54:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha how are you? how is it going on your current task?
22/07/2022, 17:19:24 - Dheeraj: Hello Adrien, I'm doing good with the current task.
I've just resumed working on the task and currently reading: https://reflectoring.io/spring-scheduler/
22/07/2022, 17:20:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): good. 
22/07/2022, 17:20:36 - Dheeraj: Looking specifically at cron expressions and the @weekly macro, might fulfill our need. trying it now
22/07/2022, 17:21:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you can also look at https://spring.io/guides/gs/scheduling-tasks/. might be redundant but generally, I prefer guides on spring.io as they are written by people close to the projects team
22/07/2022, 17:21:50 - Dheeraj: that's a good advice, sure, I'll switch over to spring.io
22/07/2022, 17:56:19 - Dheeraj: I spent the last 20 mins or so trying to find a way to write tests for the scheduled jobs until I saw a comment by someone on StackOverflow saying "This seems like a silly test. The cron expression is declarative and you should trust it". What do you think?
25/07/2022, 08:57:09 - @better_sleeping:converser.eu joined the room
25/07/2022, 08:57:12 - @better_sleeping:converser.eu left the room
25/07/2022, 10:56:31 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it's true. The cron expression doesn't need to be tested.
25/07/2022, 10:57:32 - Dheeraj: okay
25/07/2022, 12:34:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): have you tested what you have done @dheeraj?
25/07/2022, 14:19:11 - Dheeraj: I tested by putting a print statement inside the readUpdateCenter() method which prints the current time, and set the cron expression to run every 2 mins (0 */2 * * * *). And it did print every 2 mins, but as you pointed out I also need to include the "saving into DB" task while Scheduling.

So, now my latest commit schedules both of the tasks. I tested it by putting a print statement in both the methods (readUpdateCenter and saveOrUpdate) and I could see the expected output in my console.

Not sure if that correctly addresses your question.
25/07/2022, 15:12:39 - jleon33 (jleon33): 23 responses so far on the survey. Shall we send out one final reminder and thank you to those who took it already?
25/07/2022, 17:18:01 - Dheeraj: nope, something is fishy. I'm doing something wrong. I'm trying to debug now
25/07/2022, 17:33:03 - Dheeraj: Since we did receive an increased number of responses as compared to the last time you shared the numbers here, I agree with your suggestion to send a final reminder like "hey we're still accepting responses for the next 1-2 weeks, and then we'll be closing"...but I'll defer to others' opinion on this. We can discuss this tomorrow
25/07/2022, 18:18:31 - Dheeraj: I found nothing weird, works for me locally.
When I changed the cron to `0 */2 * * * *`, I can see that in every 2 mins, `readUpdateCenter` is called once and `saveOrUpdate` is called 1800+ times, as expected.
26/07/2022, 15:59:59 - jleon33 (jleon33): will be a few minutes before im on the call
26/07/2022, 16:02:50 - Dheeraj: no worries, take your time
29/07/2022, 09:23:20 - Dheeraj: @jleon33, can you please attach the July 26 recording to our notes?
29/07/2022, 12:58:54 - jleon33 (jleon33): will do


29/07/2022, 14:40:26 - jleon33 (jleon33): been added @dheerajodha 
29/07/2022, 18:15:25 - Dheeraj: Thank you Jake ^_^
02/08/2022, 10:40:24 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha is there any issues ongoing? 
02/08/2022, 10:55:57 - Dheeraj: @alecharp 
I was able to figure out a logic to know when was the last time the scheduled method was executed, and based on that I've used a dummy ZonedDateTime value (in place of generation time of update center) and accordingly executed the updateDatabase() method only if the generation-time of UC is in future.
02/08/2022, 11:00:27 - Dheeraj: And for the env variable issue that you created yesterday, I thought to give it a try. The schedule works every minute if I run the Spring project by manually exporting the cron expression variable. But when I run the project by docker, I place that same cron-expression variable in .env file, I do not see expected results so I need to explore more on this issue.
02/08/2022, 12:02:39 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Great. Thanks for the update
02/08/2022, 20:09:46 - Dheeraj: @jleon33 when you're back, can you please add today's (Aug 02) recording to the meeting notes?
03/08/2022, 10:24:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'll do that
03/08/2022, 10:26:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): but I cannot change the permission to let everyone access it.
03/08/2022, 13:45:11 - Dheeraj: @alecharp Sorry but I just realized there's one more holiday that I forgot to mention on our yesterday's call. It's a company-wide recharge day on August 12.
03/08/2022, 17:33:30 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): noted. no problem
04/08/2022, 13:25:55 - Dheeraj: @alecharp, I'm almost done reviewing your Probe Engine PR (currently understanding the test file). I was side by side reading the documentation of the GitHub class to understand what some of the methods are really doing. Will submit the review soon, thanks!
04/08/2022, 14:46:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): great
04/08/2022, 14:47:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): btw, the rate limit issue is bad. I couldn't get to have two probes using the GitHub API  without having API rate limitation. 
04/08/2022, 14:55:54 - Dheeraj: I've submitted my review.
04/08/2022, 14:57:58 - Dheeraj: Okay, noted. I see in the issue you've created that JGit is something I can explore.
04/08/2022, 15:58:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): answered
04/08/2022, 15:59:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I would probably prefer that you look into https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/23
05/08/2022, 12:34:42 - Dheeraj: ok sure, I'm currently going to spend short time on using the env variable to configure scheduling, and then quickly come back to this
05/08/2022, 12:45:41 - Dheeraj: @alecharp I'm trying to shift the cron expression inside the .env file (with content: `SC=0 */1 * * * *`) and have replaced the "cronexpression" field's value in application.properties to use the ${SC}.

When I try to run the application manually using "mvn spring-boot:run" everything works well (when I exported the SC value before it). But when I try to run the application using the `docker compose down`, `docker compose up --build` command I see the following error:


`plugin-health-scoring-db-1   | 2022-08-05 10:40:06.686 UTC [79] ERROR:  constraint "uk_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po" of relation "plugins" does not exist`
`plugin-health-scoring-db-1   | 2022-08-05 10:40:06.686 UTC [79] STATEMENT:  alter table plugins drop constraint UK_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po`
05/08/2022, 12:49:08 - Dheeraj: When I test my connection to the DB from my IDE, it shows a successful connection.
05/08/2022, 12:54:24 - Dheeraj: Hmm, interesting. So, when I just checkout to main branch, even then I see the same error while running `docker compose up`
05/08/2022, 13:00:25 - Dheeraj: I also tried to generate the latest jar by running: `mvn package -DskipTests` but still the same error.

oops, this error was present even during my midterm presentation (https://youtu.be/loLSNdCv6K4?t=1294) I guess it can be ignored...
05/08/2022, 13:06:11 - Dheeraj: Message deleted
05/08/2022, 14:38:48 - Dheeraj: opened a PR, a test indicates that the env var is not getting read.
on it.
07/08/2022, 06:52:30 - Dheeraj: Message deleted
07/08/2022, 07:00:26 - Dheeraj: FYI: https://community.jenkins.io/t/abandonment-risk-assessment-for-embedded-open-source-components/3177
07/08/2022, 16:20:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): The error is not about misconnection but because the code is trying to save in the DB  plugin which is already in the DB
08/08/2022, 08:59:15 - Dheeraj: Okay. Thanks for letting me know
08/08/2022, 09:25:03 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): read the error message, it should be putting you in the correct direction. Btw, this shouldn't happen. so I hope you have investigated the root cause of the issue
08/08/2022, 12:30:31 - Dheeraj: I get the same error even when the database is initially empty, so I' confused if the code is trying to save a plugin in DB which already exists there beforehand.

The message tells me that this command is being executed: "alter table plugins drop constraint UK_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po"
Result of which is: "constraint "uk_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po" of relation "plugins" does not exist".

I removed the "unique = true" from the `name` field in `Plugin` but still see that error.

I searched what this "uk_..." is and when I describe my "plugins" table by using "\d plugins" I see there's an index available:
`"uk_6xe1v0fh7nkqho8mf1fppi1po" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (name)`
08/08/2022, 12:33:53 - Dheeraj: I don't know why I'm seeing a unique constraint automatically create on the `name` field, maybe because of the definition we have in our `equals()` and/or `hashcode()` method.
08/08/2022, 12:38:09 - Dheeraj: What I don't understand is why would it complain when we try to add an already-existing plugin object. Because as per the current implementation of our `saveOrUpdate` method, we check if there's any object in the database with the same name as the current plugin object.

If yes, then we just update its field with setters and use `map(pluginRepository::save)` to UPDATE the object.

If not, then we simply use `pluginRepository.save(plugin)` to save the object.
08/08/2022, 12:57:42 - jleon33 (jleon33): access has been updated. sorry for the delay!
08/08/2022, 16:31:08 - Dheeraj: @alecharp Today afternoon I spent some time investigating the constraint-related error as discussed above, then I moved to the enabling batch updates task.
After reading a tutorial and watching a video I learned that it can be enabled by adding 2 lines in application.properties file (`batch_size` and `order_updates`).
08/08/2022, 18:01:05 - Dheeraj: Right now I'm testing it
08/08/2022, 18:37:18 - Dheeraj: The way I'm currently trying to see whether the updates are being done in batches is by adding this line: `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.generate_statistics=true` in application.properties file, and wrote a temporary test that adds 50 plugin objects in DB then fetches them (with `findAll()`) and adds them again with `saveAll()` method. This generated some stats which mention the number of batches and time taken by their execution.

I'm curious about how did you test it? I'm guessing you didn't just add 2 lines and got done. Did you use "PreparedStatement Batch Updates" instead?
09/08/2022, 14:23:24 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you don't need PreparedStatement
09/08/2022, 14:25:20 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): but currently we save one plugin at a time
09/08/2022, 15:32:05 - Dheeraj: okay :thumbsup:
09/08/2022, 15:58:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): look at the method "saveAll" in the repository parent interface
15/08/2022, 15:12:02 - jleon33 (jleon33): Happy independence day Dheeraj and Aditya! 
15/08/2022, 15:25:03 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much Jake!!  \(^_^)/
15/08/2022, 16:09:16 - jleon33 (jleon33): Question, I can make a copy of the survey to keep the results separate from maintainers, but do we want to share a  survey out to end users of Jenkins. Might be good ammunition to have and compare the priorities/perceptions of users vs maintainers
15/08/2022, 16:20:56 - Dheeraj: Sounds good to me. I think there's no harm in sending a separate survey to users as well
15/08/2022, 18:08:51 - jleon33 (jleon33): here is a copy of the survey, tweaked marginally to address users instead of maintainers. https://forms.gle/NN53DJeDkzWD2LXp7
15/08/2022, 18:09:00 - jleon33 (jleon33): feel free to share out to jenkins users you know 
16/08/2022, 02:32:19 - Dheeraj: thanks, how are we going to share this with Jenkins users, other than 1:1 communication?
would the jenkins-users mailing list be a good option? If I checked correctly, it has 20k people subscribed to it.
16/08/2022, 13:54:24 - jleon33 (jleon33): I think that would be our best option. Not sure if there are some rules or what have you around sending things out to that list? I will check with JMM 
16/08/2022, 14:43:47 - Dheeraj: @alecharp while running the main branch locally, do you see the results of the scm validation probe in the `details` Map of each plugin?
19/08/2022, 11:00:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier):  hello @dheerajodha. How things are going?
19/08/2022, 13:39:21 - Dheeraj: Hello Adrien, thank you for checking in! I was going to share the updates with you but then it slipped from my mind sorry
So, just for exploring/testing, I created a new project on IntelliJ where I write the JGit probes to confirm if the logic works or not. I found it faster to run this project instead of running our main project every 30 seconds.

So, I was able to fetch the last commit date of the repo using its scm link. It would not take much time to add this logic as a new probe to our project.
19/08/2022, 13:40:53 - Dheeraj: While I was trying to do that by first pulling the content of the latest PR merged, and then running the project I noticed that the probe engine throws an exception on a specific plugin's scm. That plugin is "google-deployment-manager" and it has a weird SCM link: "https://github.com/jenkinsci/${project.gitProjectId}"
19/08/2022, 14:44:23 - Dheeraj: I also noticed that inside the `saveOrUpdate` method, I'm not updating the `details` Map of each plugin. Due to this, none of the new results of our probe engine are getting stored in the DB.

And, if I'm not wrong, there isn't any plugin that is hitting the `ProbeResult.success` criteria of the `SCMLinkValidationProbe`. So, none of the plugin's scm is returning a `statusCode` of 200.
19/08/2022, 14:52:57 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I see that I didn't include the new GITHUB_OAUTH env var requirement in the `README.md` file
19/08/2022, 14:53:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): see https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps
19/08/2022, 14:53:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/7279a05c6b283062ab59df93d9cf154e57f35532/src/main/resources/application.yaml#L14
19/08/2022, 15:03:16 - Dheeraj: Thanks for the reminder, works now. I'll update the readme
22/08/2022, 08:47:39 - Dheeraj: [Update]: I ran the project with the new probe which adds the last commit date of each plugin into the DB. I'm doing that by cloning each plugin repo, which soon produced the problem of low space in my laptop so I'll switch to my personal laptop (which is crashed for more than a week now, as I installed ubuntu 20.04) from tomorrow as it won't have any space issue.

Then I tried to delete the plugin repo right after probe analysis of each plugin ends, which doesn't give any space issues. So, now I see the object of this probe in the DB alongside "scm" and "deprecations" probes. I'll push a PR within 6hrs as I need to try to clean the code first.
22/08/2022, 14:23:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): once the last commit is found, you can delete the clone. well, you need to cleanup
22/08/2022, 15:02:33 - Dheeraj: yes, I will clean the code and then open a PR.
23/08/2022, 14:42:11 - jleon33 (jleon33): howdy @dheerajodha - how goes it? Would you like to meet up today? or just chat async? 
23/08/2022, 15:22:06 - jleon33 (jleon33): Is our architecture diagram still up to date? I would think so, I just want to make sure. I plan on showing it in the DevOps World presentation
23/08/2022, 15:29:08 - Dheeraj: heyyy Jake, going greaaat! I wrote my first probe and opened a PR so pretty happy.
23/08/2022, 15:30:57 - Dheeraj: oh right, Adrien is out of office, I forgot.
so no, there's no need for a meeting from my side. I have some observations regarding the code which now I'll just share here instead
23/08/2022, 15:42:02 - Dheeraj: its complete-ish
I need to remove the tilted squares near the "Postgres Database" which will further simplify the diagram. As suggested by Adrien previously while we were discussing this, I'd re-make this diagram using GitHub's Mermaid so that the interested people from your DevOps World presentation can see this diagram in our repo as well. I think I'll be able to do this before your talk
23/08/2022, 15:42:22 - jleon33 (jleon33): Please remind me, do we have an idea of how the math will work for calculating the scores? or did we hold off on that as its a bit down the line and probably out of scope?
23/08/2022, 15:43:03 - jleon33 (jleon33): Ok, let me know. Not a huge rush. I think the final deadline for the presentations is aug 31. 
23/08/2022, 15:45:07 - Dheeraj: oo okay, thanks for letting me know. will get it done before aug 31 for sure 👌 
23/08/2022, 15:57:45 - Dheeraj: We didn't have any discussion on this in Phase 1 and not in this phase as well because it felt its a bit down the line. But the math written in my proposal doc "just works", it will give you the final scores out of 100, though it can be improved and updated.

I'll add it as a discussion topic for our next meeting (aug 30) where all of us would be there.
23/08/2022, 16:00:11 - Dheeraj: ^ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTbcWh5C1KrCgEzgqeVEPyfr1H5fH5eTj8KpbWrWsSY/edit#bookmark=id.j1mz28d6k5s1
23/08/2022, 16:32:57 - jleon33 (jleon33): thank you sir!
23/08/2022, 16:41:01 - Dheeraj: @alecharp, regarding what we discussed in our last meeting, I'm referring to the timestamp 27:27 in the recording (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DD2jxYv8UCblpb-LOY-qDhoeLHCzbjSG/view). You said that regarding my new probe file, when I'm querying the plugin's `details` Map to get the value of the "previously executed" probe (which is SCMLinkValidationProbe), I won't be able to access this value since this has not been added to the database yet. That's true, but I noticed that for every probe, when it is done executing on a given plugin, we are adding its `ProbeResult`into the plugin's `details`map. And the `probeResult`of this probe would be available for the next probe to do some checks with. So, with this approach which I'm using currently, things are working fine.
23/08/2022, 16:48:19 - Dheeraj: But while I was writing this message, I realized what you also said when you realized that I'm querying a plugin's `details` map to get the `ProbeResult`of the previously executed probe. I see, you meant that this is not the way we'd like to do things. We'd like to instead pass context down from one related probe to another, so the probes won't need to check the values from the `details` map.

If I'm visualizing it correctly, this is similar to a funnel that has another funnel below it, then there's another funnel below it, almost like a continuous pathway between all of them which helps in passing relevant information from one probe to another.

And this is what your latest PR (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/32) aims to do.

Did I get this right?
23/08/2022, 18:00:55 - Dheeraj: Added a comment (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/32/files#r952818504) on your PR, if you'd like to continue this conversation there
26/08/2022, 19:53:39 - jleon33 (jleon33): can y'all give me a short bio about yourself for my devops world presentation? @alecharp @ADI10HERO @dheerajodha 
29/08/2022, 14:41:26 - jleon33 (jleon33): Will not be at tomorrows call as I have a conflict 😟 
29/08/2022, 20:30:26 - Dheeraj: Sorry for the late reply. Suddenly I don't know how to write a bio. I couldn't think of anything else to add (suggestions are welcome!)...

30/08/2022, 08:44:25 - Dheeraj: Hi @alecharp 
Thank you for the help on my latest PR, I'm now going over your commits.
30/08/2022, 17:38:43 - jleon33 (jleon33): @ADI10HERO I need a a quick bio from you please. I also took @dheerajodha and @ADI10HERO linkedin pictures for my presentation
31/08/2022, 04:54:35 - kuro: Hey jleon33 (jleon33)  please take it from here https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/adi10hero
31/08/2022, 14:06:43 - jleon33 (jleon33): thanks that is great. do you prefer that picture or linked in?
31/08/2022, 20:38:50 - jleon33 (jleon33): @dheerajodha have we updated the architecture diagram yet?
01/09/2022, 13:48:36 - Dheeraj: I made some changes a few days ago in the draw.io link of the diagram but forgot to update the image in the document, I did it now. Earlier I was thinking we might not need to add more details (like which process is running on a schedule, etc etc) but maybe we should add more details in the diagram to give an accurate representation of how the project works from the start to end. I'm adding it now within a couple of hours
01/09/2022, 14:16:01 - jleon33 (jleon33): I just need it to be generally correct, and can speak to the finer details
01/09/2022, 14:17:32 - jleon33 (jleon33): I am going to use the one thats there, thank you so much :) 
01/09/2022, 14:38:07 - Dheeraj: That's what I thought too, like it has to be generally correct. But @alecharp showed some concerns about the diagram in the last meeting before you joined... (PS: I fixed a wording mistake in the diagram, just updated it)
01/09/2022, 17:46:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha I fixed the PR
01/09/2022, 17:46:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if you could test it locally that would be great.
01/09/2022, 17:47:26 - Dheeraj: Okay sure, I'll test it now
01/09/2022, 17:51:20 - Dheeraj: The test is passing now, thank you very much
01/09/2022, 18:27:25 - Dheeraj: And for example, for plugin="aws-java-sdk-logs",
"scm" probe gives SUCCESS, and "last-commit-date" probe gives SUCESS with commit date Oct 18, 2022 (can be verified form here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/aws-java-sdk-plugin/tree/master/aws-java-sdk-logs)
01/09/2022, 18:28:47 - Dheeraj: Now we are also able to get the commit date for the submodules of the repository :thumbsup: 
02/09/2022, 11:01:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha how's the test on PR-32?
02/09/2022, 11:07:57 - Dheeraj: Working on it now, I'll commit the test asap
02/09/2022, 13:09:12 - Dheeraj: I'm trying to push tests to your PR but getting a "permission denied" error. Can you check the box in the PR which says “Allow edits from maintainers.”?
02/09/2022, 15:32:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): how did you checkout my branch? 
02/09/2022, 16:15:37 - Dheeraj: Using these 2 commands:
`git checkout -b alecharp-feature/probe-engine-execution-context main`
`git pull https://github.com/alecharp/plugin-health-scoring.git feature/probe-engine-execution-context`
02/09/2022, 16:16:35 - Dheeraj: Then created a remote named "mentor" and pushed my changes with this command:
`git push mentor alecharp-feature/probe-engine-execution-context:feature/probe-engine-execution-context`
02/09/2022, 17:27:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): would have been easier to use GH CLI command
05/09/2022, 10:23:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheeraj, how is it going? 
05/09/2022, 10:28:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please see that I send you an invite to contribute to my fork, you need to accept it and then you will be able to push to it
05/09/2022, 10:51:29 - Dheeraj: yes, I have just accepted the invitation :thumbsup: 
05/09/2022, 10:56:18 - Dheeraj: I'm currently working on revamping the `UpdateCenterService` file, to take out the probe-related processing from this file and put it into its own file inside the `probes/` package.

I'll give you an update on this within 4 hours.
05/09/2022, 11:12:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please, if you have new tests for the context PR, don't move on to something less
05/09/2022, 12:09:07 - Dheeraj: I'm sorry Adrien for the miscommunication, I didn't add any more tests because those 2 unit tests answered my question. I'll think and add more tests to the context PR now :thumbsup: 
06/09/2022, 07:11:14 - Dheeraj: hi @alecharp, can you please let me know what's remaining in PR 32?
06/09/2022, 10:01:05 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): nothing I think. I'll merge it
06/09/2022, 17:53:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha I would need a like +1 on https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/37. could you review it?
06/09/2022, 18:31:20 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it cannot be merged until you review it
06/09/2022, 18:32:21 - Dheeraj: Hi Adrien
06/09/2022, 18:33:07 - Dheeraj: Sorry for the delay, I went for dinner. I'll review this now, please give me a few mins
06/09/2022, 18:35:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): sure no problem
06/09/2022, 18:36:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha please see https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite
06/09/2022, 18:37:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm going offline now. 
06/09/2022, 18:51:26 - Dheeraj: Yes, sure. I actually found that in my 2 tests I didn't mock one method due to that I'm seeing a null pointer problem.
So, I'm pushing that now, I checked it multiple times just to be sure so it took longer-than-expected time. I'm sorry to keep you waiting, please come back to this tomorrow if you like.
06/09/2022, 19:10:37 - Dheeraj: Thank you for sharing this link, I'll go through this :thumbsup:

08/09/2022, 08:44:04 - Dheeraj: @alecharp I'm still working on my update-center related task, I will create a PR in a few hours.
08/09/2022, 10:24:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): any blockers?
08/09/2022, 14:41:58 - Dheeraj: I've been trying since our weekly call to work on the comments you wrote on the issue. I want to present to you something concrete and then ask for corrections from you. I know time is running out, so I'll create a PR within the next 50 mins.
08/09/2022, 15:53:10 - Dheeraj: I've put up the PR and I'm adding my comments to it, which would describe my doubts and concerns. I know it's far from the right solution, but I put it up anyway.
08/09/2022, 18:53:43 - hervelemeur joined the room
08/09/2022, 18:53:50 - hervelemeur: Hi!
08/09/2022, 18:54:30 - hervelemeur: I saw this PR and I'm wondering if these plugins scores shouldn't be affected somehow: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/backend-extension-indexer/pull/39#issuecomment-1240966890
08/09/2022, 18:55:19 - hervelemeur: better link: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/backend-extension-indexer/pull/41
09/09/2022, 12:20:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm not sure to understand the PR , however, anything could be a probe in the end and everything can impact any plugin score. However, the project is not yet in the state where we generate a score for any plugin.
09/09/2022, 13:25:13 - Dheeraj: I discussed this with Mark during the Docs Office hours today, as per my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong), the backend-extension-indexer tool generates the extension points (https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/) for core and some selected plugins (which are marked with @Extension).

This PR updated some criteria of this tool, which caused some failures because those 167 plugins are not modern enough (eg. they don't support Java 11 etc).

We agreed that this could be an "advanced" probe because it is not applicable to all plugins but only to some selected few. And this probe isn't concerned with the users so we can add this a little later in the future. Lmk if you have any thoughts on this
11/09/2022, 18:31:44 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny): AFAIK the tool actually tries to index all plugins, so the list of failures there may be a good indicator of which plugins are actually not able to run on Java 11. That may be a useful probe since many plugins may indicate Java 8 in POM and still run fine with both 8 and 11.
12/09/2022, 07:53:44 - Dheeraj: That is interesting, thanks for letting me know.
We will discuss this and plugin-site-issue (where you @ me) in our weekly meetings, and I'll propose to record these probe ideas somewhere so we can work on them.
12/09/2022, 10:09:23 - Dheeraj: Hi @alecharp,
I have completed a blog post on this project, I will open a PR on jenkins.io asap.
12/09/2022, 12:43:14 - Dheeraj: I've created a PR here: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5440 
cc: @jleon33
12/09/2022, 14:07:26 - Dheeraj: And now I'm working on PR-38.
Sorry for nudging, please don't mind it but how is it going on with the deployment? I need to add it to the form by tonight
12/09/2022, 14:12:43 - hervelemeur: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha):  It won't be deployed by tonight ^^
What do you need to add to your form? The url?
12/09/2022, 14:16:08 - Dheeraj: Yes 😟
This is what the form says:
12/09/2022, 14:16:14 - Dheeraj: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/6296203f6da037398497b03b/OTDa/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/6296203f6da037398497b03b/OTDa/image.png)
12/09/2022, 14:17:18 - hervelemeur: OK
12/09/2022, 14:18:09 - hervelemeur: Are you all OK with `plugin-health.jenkins.io`?
No `scoring` in it? (`plugin-health-scoring.jenkins.io`)
12/09/2022, 14:19:39 - Dheeraj: Out of curiosity, is `-scoring` clashing with something?
12/09/2022, 14:19:49 - hervelemeur: nothing
12/09/2022, 14:20:11 - hervelemeur: This url choice a matter of taste
12/09/2022, 14:20:59 - hervelemeur: `plugin-health.jenkins.io` comes from https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3114
12/09/2022, 14:24:35 - Dheeraj: Okay :thumbsup:, I don't have a strong preference. Let's go with: `plugin-health.jenkins.io`as long as you're okay with it.
12/09/2022, 14:24:52 - hervelemeur: Fine for me :)
12/09/2022, 14:25:10 - Dheeraj: awesome!
12/09/2022, 14:25:18 - hervelemeur: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha): I'd put this url in your form, even if there isn't anything here yet
12/09/2022, 14:27:15 - hervelemeur: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha):  if you create a simple html with the project description (and state?) and set it as a github page I can add a temporary DNS record to point to it as a placeholder while the deployment isn't ready
12/09/2022, 14:28:06 - hervelemeur: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
12/09/2022, 14:29:30 - hervelemeur: <del>it doesn't matter where you create the corresponding repository</del>, this page will get a https://\<user>.github.io/\<repository> url, I'll redirect plugin-health.jenkins.io to it, and will remove this redirection as soon as the project is ready.
12/09/2022, 14:30:00 - hervelemeur: KISS for now ;)
12/09/2022, 14:32:58 - hervelemeur: > it doesn't matter where you create the corresponding repository

scratch that, use this one: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring-placeholder-website
I'm setting up github page and the redirection on it.
12/09/2022, 14:41:51 - hervelemeur: https://jenkins-infra.github.io/plugin-health-scoring-placeholder-website/
12/09/2022, 14:42:00 - hervelemeur: use the gh-pages branch for the content
12/09/2022, 14:42:10 - hervelemeur: (I've added your team as maintainer)
12/09/2022, 14:43:29 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much Hervé for your help!

12/09/2022, 14:43:53 - Dheeraj: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/6296203f6da037398497b03b/AKVH/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/6296203f6da037398497b03b/AKVH/image.png)
12/09/2022, 14:44:07 - Dheeraj: This is what the current UI looks like as prepared by Adrien:
12/09/2022, 14:45:35 - Dheeraj: We're using Thymeleaf to do this (PR: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/27), just letting you know
12/09/2022, 14:49:31 - Dheeraj: okay, I'm looking into it
12/09/2022, 14:53:35 - hervelemeur: Useful link: https://docs.github.com/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll
12/09/2022, 14:54:21 - hervelemeur: Again, I wouldn't spend too much time on it.
Choose a theme, add a short description and that should be more than enough.
12/09/2022, 14:58:08 - hervelemeur: It's "live" now: https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/
12/09/2022, 14:58:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): why don't you use the github repository for the URL? 
12/09/2022, 14:58:39 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): we will put the URL of the deployed application on the repository once it's up
12/09/2022, 14:58:49 - hervelemeur: Yeah, better indeed. I went with a separate repo as it was faster for me to setup without interfering
12/09/2022, 14:59:56 - hervelemeur: we can revisit the current state, let me know
12/09/2022, 15:00:55 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm speaking mostly about the URL @dheerajodha could use in the form for GSoC
12/09/2022, 15:01:33 - hervelemeur: as shown in the screenshot, they suggest to use a definitive url as it can't be changed later
12/09/2022, 15:14:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the repository won't move.
12/09/2022, 15:21:22 - Dheeraj: @alecharp so you mean this: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring literally the repo URL?
I got confused with the GitHub pages site activated on this repo at: https://jenkins-infra.github.io/plugin-health-scoring/
12/09/2022, 15:23:14 - hervelemeur: > I got confused with the GitHub pages site activated on this repo at: https://jenkins-infra.github.io/plugin-health-scoring/

Ooohh... I'll remove the new repo and use this page, better.
And yes alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) means putting the repository url in your form, as it won't change, and will have a link to plugin-health.jenkins.io when finished.
12/09/2022, 15:30:56 - Dheeraj: Okay sure, earlier I thought I wouldn't have necessary permission to activate the GH pages site on this repo, but I was wrong

That makes total sense, thanks very much for your quick help!!
12/09/2022, 16:32:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): GH pages are generated based on a branch on the repository.
16/09/2022, 18:24:43 - jleon33 (jleon33): any help needed on the final slides @dheerajodha 
19/09/2022, 06:18:14 - Dheeraj: Hey @jleon33, sorry for the late reply I was on PTO when you texted
Yup, I need help, I'll put together the slides, and let's meet today (Monday) at around 5 pm UTC.
Would that work for you?
19/09/2022, 15:51:43 - Dheeraj: and/or tomorrow (your time), whatever works for you
19/09/2022, 17:12:53 - jleon33 (jleon33): just let me know when youd like to meet. we can set up a call
19/09/2022, 17:13:32 - jleon33 (jleon33): I can do 5pm UTC. I think thats 1pm EDT? that works fo rme
19/09/2022, 18:00:06 - Dheeraj: awesome

03/10/2022, 16:39:47 - jleon33 (jleon33): @jmmeessen:matrix.org is there a way to change the name of this chat (remove the GSoC part of it) so this can function as the main chat for the plugin health scoring discussions? Or would we be better off creating a new channel?
04/10/2022, 10:24:33 - Jmm: Hi jleon33 (jleon33) 
Will look into this later during the day. Otherwise we can alway create a new one (but loose the history)
04/10/2022, 16:10:38 - jleon33 (jleon33): thank you sir! 
07/10/2022, 12:08:47 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): either I lack the permission or it's not possible, but I didn't find a way to rename the gitter channel. based on https://github.com/ethereumjs/organization/issues/15#issuecomment-368826812 might need to involve gitter support..
07/10/2022, 14:16:42 - jmMeessen (Jean-Marc MEESSEN) joined the room
07/10/2022, 14:16:43 - jmMeessen (Jean-Marc MEESSEN): I checked and the easiest way to go is to create a new channel. And this will not break the links on the various pages where this channel is referenced. @jleon33 @alecharp 
07/10/2022, 19:03:03 - Dheeraj: Hello all, the PR is open for review. Please give it a look if you have time.

Any objections?
10/10/2022, 16:29:44 - hervelemeur: > @alecharp: as per  @hervelemeur:matrix.org's suggestion

10/10/2022, 16:35:12 - Dheeraj: Yes :thumbsup: 
Also,  @hervelemeur:matrix.org which one do you prefer?
`The URL plugin-health.jenkins.io is live` or `The site plugin-health.jenkins.io is live`
10/10/2022, 16:35:27 - hervelemeur: the second one :)
10/10/2022, 16:35:43 - Dheeraj: cool, ill update
10/10/2022, 16:36:49 - hervelemeur: I would inverse the phrase, putting "thanks to the helm chart.... on Kubernetes, the site ... is live."
10/10/2022, 16:37:17 - hervelemeur: as the helm chart isn't the only reason the site is live, if at first position it's not as much implied
10/10/2022, 16:37:46 - Dheeraj: Message deleted
10/10/2022, 16:38:27 - hervelemeur: the helm chart facilitated the app deployment, but isn't enough on its own, although sufficient as a short explanation of its usefullness.
10/10/2022, 16:41:39 - Dheeraj: thanks for the info :thumbsup:, I've update it now

11/10/2022, 18:37:18 - Dheeraj: Done, thank you!

It went really well! I had 3 minutes and I think I was able to describe the project, its need, status, and future, pretty clearly. A couple of fellow presenters like me, who I connected on LinkedIn after the summit, found the project interesting as well. There were over 100 people on the call all-throughout, so it was very cool

Unfortunately, they did not record any presentations which I found very weird. But they did offer a gift code to presenters and I selected a "Google ❤️ Open Source" TShirt 😃

I'm visiting my hometown so I would be away from my laptop from Dec 3 to Dec 14. I wasn't able to make progress on the PR because I was wrapping up some unplanned tasks on priority before I leave. With that said, I'm still interested to work on the PR when I get back but please feel free to close it or pick it up if you feel like this task needs to be worked on priority.

20/01/2023, 10:58:30 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Hi, team just wanted to give a quick introduction. This is mandeep, I am an open source enthusiast looking forward to contribute to the plugin_health_score project and  make some valuable contributions.
20/01/2023, 10:59:03 - hervelemeur: Welcome!
20/01/2023, 11:05:47 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Hello Mandeep, glad to have you.
20/01/2023, 11:08:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so, in order to run the application locally, what you need to have is a local database running. You can start is as you wish, but there is an helper in the project in the form of a `docker compose` command: you can just run `docker compose run db -d` to start a database locally. This is using a `.env` file content to setup from credentials. You can see an example of that file in `.env.example`
20/01/2023, 11:14:59 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): once you have your database, you need to make sure those credentials are known by the spring-boot application. To do that, if you run the application from command line (`mvn spring-boot:run`) then you need to export manually the environment variables in your shell (or bash or whatever) 
20/01/2023, 11:15:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so it would be something like `export POSTGRES_HOST = localhost`,  `export POSTGRES_PORT=5432`, `export POSTGRES_USER=whatever`, etc.
20/01/2023, 11:16:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and only then, on the same shell, you can run `mvn spring-boot:run`
20/01/2023, 16:40:20 - Dheeraj: Welcome Mandeep!
20/01/2023, 16:48:54 - Dheeraj: @alecharp While running `mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn` the cron string for `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON` gives the following error:

```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Encountered invalid @Scheduled method 'run': Cron expression must consist of 6 fields (found 7 in "* 5 */2 * * * *")
```

I exported this variable manually beforehand with the value taken from the `.env.example` file. I ran this command in an attempt to reproduce this error posted by a candidate on the gsoc-sig channel. I made the cron string to be of 6 characters and it worked afterwards. Should we update the value in the `.env.example` file?
20/01/2023, 16:55:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it seems that the .env.example has some invalid values
20/01/2023, 16:56:07 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and it is also incorrect as we need the github app and not the github token
20/01/2023, 18:15:35 - Dheeraj: okay :thumbsup: 
20/01/2023, 18:16:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): probably a good idea to see what I forgot to update in the contribution guide about that..

I'm replying to his queries here so as to have public conversations which would benefit others as well, plus I can be corrected if my responses are incorrect :)

> ...I have never implemented CI/CD pipelines practically...

I don't think it's a strict requirement for this project to know CI/CD, it's more of a 'good-to-have' skill. Just FYI, the project repository has a CI in place, which is super useful. In general, it would be great if you're familiar with CI/CD because it's a super important concept in software development.

> I will be busy from 8am to 6pm in classes and some days classes happen at night also. I will not get more than 4-5hrs to code during Normal days...

As per the GSoC guidelines, contributors are expected to at least spend at least 20 hours a week on their project. So it's your call whether you'll be able to give this much time to your project.

> Will I have flexibility to work more on some days and less on other days or do I need to stick to the plans shared by mentors and mentioned in the timeline?

I think yes, you will have some flexibility given that you clearly communicate your plans in your project proposal. Sometimes exams fall in between the contributing period so that is taken into consideration on behalf of the contributor. Also, "plans" are not shared by the mentor(s). It is expected from the mentee to make a plan of how they'll be delivering their project in the GSoC time period, so it is up to you to design your own timeline as per your availability :)

> I don’t have any idea of UI/UX designing so does this project require the knowledge of UI as it’s not mentioned in the tech stack of the project. I can learn on the go btw as I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript!

For this project idea, it's not a strict requirement to have knowledge of UI. But it would be useful if the contributor has some experience because the selected contributor might need to play a little with the frontend files.

> How have you scraped data of plugins from the repos? ... But isn’t there an upper limit to the rate of scraping data by GitHub as there are 1000s of plugins!

This is a good question. For scraping, we're largely using https://github-api.kohsuke.org/ library and data from the Jenkins Update Center: https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json. Yes, we had some problems where the API limit got exceeded and the probe engine couldn't complete its operation due to this. To solve this, Adrien integrated a GitHub App into this project which gives us a very high API requests limit (I think it's 15,000 requests per hour), which seems to work well.

> Does this project include Score Calculation Algorithm improvements?

Not exactly. This project largely deals with adding new probes to the project. But since adding new probes would require the contributor to play with the probe coefficient, etc, so you might need to do some small tweaks in the algorithms to ensure the scores are correct.

> ...can I pick up some ideas from your proposal and also ask the community about the new probes and enhancements required...

Ofcourse! That's a good idea! :)

25/01/2023, 08:17:51 - impact-maker (impact-maker): In reference to the issue #181 we have to create the health score on top every plugin as well as refine the score system to make it more accurate.  What sort of parameters should the new scoring system comprise of .
25/01/2023, 11:21:07 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Hey! This is Harsh here. I  am currently in my freshman year, situated in India, and want to contribute to plugin health score. I was trying to understand the codebase from about a week. When I try running plugin-health-scoring-app-1, the app is starting up successfully, however it is exiting automatically without any error message(can share the logs if required). Its database is not exiting automatically and seems to be working fine. I am not able to comprehend why is this happening.I have installed jenkins lts and plugin health score app on the same port so maybe that's an issue(I changed the port in compose.yml to 8081:8081 but still isn't working. I think someone should change the ports form 8080:8080 to some other unoccupied port as it can be quite confusing for newcomers who already have jenkins container on their system to first exit it and then start plugin health container. If there is some special reason for having the same ports then please share the reason). Does plugin health scoring app require jenkins to run beforehand!? Whats the mistake from my side? And I also want to access the database of plugin health scoring app. Which SQL client in IDE are you folks using. I don't have much knowledge about it sorry?
And I also have to study about Collections, Streams and other advanced Java concepts. Dont know how to configure CI/CD pipelines and never practically wrote junit tests. I am quite a noob as I never contributed to Open Source before. I will try solving some good first issues of Jenkins later, maybe you can point me to some.  @dheerajodha @alecharp

It's better to have a description of what you have in mind as an improvement or as an issue so we can understand from the start. Here, it's look more like spam to me.

> I changed the port in compose.yml to 8081:8081 but still isn't working

you should only change the export port as the application itself is still listening on port 8080. So change the port config to `8181:8080` or don't run Jenkins as the same time. It is not required to have a jenkins instance for the project
25/01/2023, 11:25:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > I think someone should change the ports form 8080:8080 to some other unoccupied port as it can be quite confusing for newcomers who already have jenkins container on their system to first exit it and then start plugin health container

it's up to you to know the available port on your computer. the compose is only here to show how you could run the application but it needs to be adapted to your need if necessary
25/01/2023, 11:26:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > If there is some special reason for having the same ports then please share the reason

it's not about having the same port. it's just that the application is listening on port 8080 and there is no reason the external port of the docker environment should listen on a different one
25/01/2023, 11:27:33 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Does plugin health scoring app require jenkins to run beforehand!?

no it doesn't. there is no mention of Jenkins on the contributing guide.
25/01/2023, 11:28:30 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): >  Which SQL client in IDE are you folks using. I don't have much knowledge about it sorry?

I'm using the client from IntelliJ IDEA
25/01/2023, 11:28:57 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Dont know how to configure CI/CD pipelines 

You don't need to, it's already done.

25/01/2023, 11:30:51 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > And I also have to study about Collections, Streams and other advanced Java concepts.

Please do as it's a requirement to not only know Java but also Programming concepts like some design pattern, dependency injection, etc.
25/01/2023, 11:31:20 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @alecharp i tried running the application independently still It was exiting on its own 😟 
btw thanks for the detailed answers 😀
25/01/2023, 11:32:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > never practically wrote junit tests.

It's a good exercise to right one before the code, thinking "what is the code supposed to do?" once you have that clear in your mind you can right a unit test doing assertion of what your code should produce based on what you are feeding it. Then you can write your code. 
25/01/2023, 11:34:25 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > I will try solving some good first issues of Jenkins later, maybe you can point me to some.

Please know that this project code is not related to Jenkins code or any Jenkins plugins code. This is a completely different project. it aims at helping maintainer knows what they can focus on on their plugin, but that's all.
25/01/2023, 11:34:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > i tried running the application independently still It was exiting on its own :(

In the dockerfile a non root user 'phs' was created for some reason(please share the reason) and i am guessing that this same user is trying to create directory in #138 . Does this user have the necessary permissions to do so? @alecharp 
25/01/2023, 17:02:42 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > In the dockerfile a non root user 'phs' was created for some reason(please share the reason)

Because it's bad practice to run anything on a Docker container as root because you  might get root access on the host and so if the image / container is compromised, the host is as well.
25/01/2023, 17:03:16 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier):  > Does this user have the necessary permissions to do so?

it should as it's trying to create that folder in its USER_HOME

I could reproduce it everytime I started the application from Docker

26/01/2023, 19:30:51 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @alecharp i am asking a pretty silly question but when i run plugin health score app 1 i am not getting this error! 
https://gist.github.com/30af2103262ddd126b3519a2f1d6026b.git
this is what i am getting by  running the app from docker. I actually dont know how to download plugins. I think i need to download some plugins for this error to show up! Kindly show me the way 😟
And i think in #138 to solve the issue i somehow need to make sure that the folder is not created multiple times. As the plugins are downloaded parallelly so creating a directory first and then downloading all the plugins in that directly seems to be a good solution to me. Can you tell me which probe is responsible for downloading plugins so that i can try my hands on this issue? 
27/01/2023, 10:27:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @impact-maker have you start your work off the existing pull-request or from scratch?
27/01/2023, 10:28:35 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @harsh-ps-2003 you need to run the probes once. it happens because the code is using jgit to clone the plugins repository. this only happens when you run the probes
27/01/2023, 10:31:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > As the plugins are downloaded parallelly so creating a directory first As the plugins are downloaded parallelly so creating a directory first 

this is a good way to go imo

> downloading all the plugins in that directly seems to be a good solution to me

the plugins are clones in the different directory. the directory which reports a problem is the git configuration directory. it's different from where the plugins are cloned.

> Can you tell me which probe is responsible for downloading plugins so that i can try my hands on this issue? 

the last commit date probe is the one cloning the repository first

There is no webhook url for this. Those are trigger with the schedulers and the CRON you have setup in the environment variables.

> I am able to see the probes and scores in the UI but not in the database:

Probes are not in the database. They are classes in the `io.jenkins.pluginhealth.scoring.probes` package.
30/01/2023, 12:26:57 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > How can I setup this database in Database browser?

Create a data source with Postgresql driver. Normally, the database container has its ports 5432 redirected to the ports 5432 on your host. So you can set the url of the database to `localhost`, port `5432` and use the username and password that you setup in the `.env` file.

> Thanks. `.env.example` solves a lot of issues. In the documentation they have only mentioned: `link:.env.example[]` Does this syntax mean to refer to `.env.example`?

Yes. This is a asciidoc syntax to show the content of `.env.example` file in the contributing file.

Will learn from the feedback and continue to make valuable contributions for the organisation. Will ask adrien in case  I face any issues. Thank you being such a supportive open source organisation.

04/02/2023, 15:32:07 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Hi @alecharp  currently I am not able to see the list of plugins and their respective set of old score(Last 5 to 10 scores). I would need some help/suggestion to reproduce the issue #193.
04/02/2023, 17:24:45 - Dheeraj: Sorry for the late response. On the terminal where you've run the command `docker compose up`, what do the logs say?

But since the `plugins` and `scores` table is empty, I think that the scheduled tasks were not executed. And by "scheduled tasks", I mean the ones whose frequency you've set in the cron expressions here in lines 12 and 14: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/.env.example

For testing, I like to set their frequency to be more frequent, eg. every 10-15 mins.
04/02/2023, 17:36:29 - Dheeraj: Sorry for the late response. I'm not sure which way you're running the app (via the "CLI" or "Docker Compose" method), but what exactly are you seeing? and what are you expecting to see?
05/02/2023, 11:11:22 - impact-maker (impact-maker): @alecharp @dheerajodha @jleon33 I am looking forward to implement the probe to see if spotbugs is configured/enabled. It would be really helpful to get some resources to implement and test a probe. Some insights on spotbugs would also be helpful. Also should I send across a introductory pull request for the issue made by @jleon33 as I have started the initial part of the frontend for the spotbug probe. 
05/02/2023, 13:40:31 - Kris Stern: Hi impact-maker (impact-maker) Even though I am not one of the potential mentors for the project, but as one of the GSoC org admins I would say it would be highly inappropriate to start to engage in any direct work that is supposed to be a significant part of the proposed GSoC project idea, as this seems like jumping the gun for me. 
05/02/2023, 13:42:28 - Kris Stern: This may in fact have a negative impact on your proposal getting selected
05/02/2023, 14:29:49 - Kris Stern: I do understand you have an interest in working on [#151](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/151), but while you are at it, do be careful of the scope of the task you take on. 
06/02/2023, 07:08:48 - Dheeraj: Refer to the contributing guide to see how to set up the project locally. I'm assuming you have done that already, so your database should already be populated with the plugins and their scores. To better understand your situation, what have you tried so far, and which error are you seeing?
06/02/2023, 10:07:31 - impact-maker (impact-maker): I have checked the database now it is showing the plugin as well as the scores. I was checking the frontend for the same, so wanted to confirm that does the frontend currently have only two tabs- One for probes list and the other scores list page and no tab for the plugin list(Only the database entries  stores the plugin list). 
06/02/2023, 10:45:03 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): no, the application is not meant to be listing the plugins
06/02/2023, 10:45:44 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): however, you can access the score of a specific plugin by taping the url `/scores/PLUGIN_NAME` (replacing `PLUGIN_NAME`)
06/02/2023, 10:47:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I wouldn't suggestion to start with this for now. This probe is rather complex and potentially blocked by a pull request I made on another project which hasn't been merged nor released.
06/02/2023, 10:49:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I would also suggest that you keep your focus on what you want to contribute because a week ago, you offered to look into https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/193, which is not part of any GSoC project so it's fine for that, but you haven't proposed anything about it. 
06/02/2023, 10:51:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > I have started the initial part of the frontend for the spotbug probe. 

I'm not sure I understand because probes don't have frontend development requirement.
06/02/2023, 21:33:48 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Hi  @alecharp  I needed some more clarity on the problem statement.
06/02/2023, 21:39:31 - impact-maker (impact-maker): Currently I am able to see two scores fetched for every plugin id for two specific dates. So are we looking to fetch only the top 5-10 scores in database table or every plugin we just want the latest 5 scores. Any screenshot on the current issue would be quite helpful to fully understand the problem statement.
06/02/2023, 21:43:45 - impact-maker (impact-maker): @alecharp I was trying to work on both the issues/enhancements to get a better code coverage and understanding. Will try to  work on the scoring issue for now and avoid getting my hands on spotbugs probe as suggested by @jleon33.
07/02/2023, 10:00:45 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): we just want to keep 5 scores for each plugin
07/02/2023, 10:01:08 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm not sure what screenshot you might need.. 
08/02/2023, 07:08:55 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,
 

Can someone explain me what UpdateCenter does?

Here is what I have understood: 

`UpdateCenter.java` is an empty class.

 

In `ProbeEngine.java` `UpdateCenter` is called this way: 

`final UpdateCenter updateCenter = updateCenterService.fetchUpdateCenter();`

`fetchUpdateCenter()` reads and returns an URL. 

Also, from `ProbeContext` class I understand, it gives additional information about each probe like: lastCommitData, github repo, etc. 
08/02/2023, 07:20:57 - Jagruti: Even in `ProbeContext` it return `UpdateCenter`. How does it function?

```
    public ProbeContext(String pluginName, UpdateCenter updateCenter) throws IOException {
        this.updateCenter = updateCenter;
        this.scmRepository = Files.createTempDirectory(pluginName);
    }

    public UpdateCenter getUpdateCenter() {
        return updateCenter;
    }

```

Could you let me know how to reproduce the last 5-10 scores corresponding to each plugin id. This was the screenshot I was talking about in the last thread
08/02/2023, 13:10:57 - Jagruti: Hey
 
 Can someone explain me the difference between:

https://github.com/Jagrutiti/plugin-health-scoring/blob/d30b46817dba4ac5d2aea8decfaaaf0f982e805d/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/probes/DeprecatedPluginProbe.java#L45 
 
and

08/02/2023, 13:11:18 - Jagruti: These are two different lines of `DeprecatedPluginProbe` to call the update-center.
 
First one with `ProbeContext` object second one using `updateCenter.Plugin`
08/02/2023, 13:11:27 - Jagruti: I know it is the syntax I do not understand how `plugins()` came into the picture in line no. 49?
08/02/2023, 13:14:40 - Jagruti: This line is similar too:

https://github.com/Jagrutiti/plugin-health-scoring/blob/d30b46817dba4ac5d2aea8decfaaaf0f982e805d/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/scores/DeprecatedPluginScoring.java#L51

When I do `final ProbeResult deprecatedPluginProbeResult = plugin.` intellij does not suggest `getDetails()` method.

08/02/2023, 14:23:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): This is the Java representation of the update-center file
08/02/2023, 14:23:46 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > fetchUpdateCenter() reads and returns an URL. 

not quite. it reads the file behind an URL and returns the content of that file
08/02/2023, 14:24:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Also, from ProbeContext class I understand, it gives additional information about each probe like: lastCommitData, github repo, etc. 
08/02/2023, 14:24:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): correct
08/02/2023, 14:25:19 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): This is so, when we are executing all the probes on each individual plugin, we are not trying to download the update center every single time.
08/02/2023, 14:25:42 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this way, the update-center is downloaded once, at the beginning of the probeengine execution 
08/02/2023, 14:26:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it also makes sure that the same update-center content is used for all the plugins
08/02/2023, 14:27:25 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this means that the scoreengine produced only 2 scores for each plugin so far in your local environment. 
08/02/2023, 14:27:47 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Change your `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON` environment variable to produce more of them
08/02/2023, 14:29:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): The first one is assigning to a local variable the reference to a `UpdateCenter` object which is referenced in the `ProbeContext` object passed as a parameter of the method
08/02/2023, 14:30:39 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the second one is assigning to a local variable the reference of an update-center `Plugin` which can be retrieved from the `plugins` map in the `UpdateCenter` object
08/02/2023, 14:34:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): note that those are two different classes
08/02/2023, 14:39:53 - Dheeraj: just for reference, this is where the update center URL is getting read from: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/2ebf654ed43a68deb9adebb8c127ae9f0729a5e5/src/main/resources/application.yaml#L22
08/02/2023, 14:40:19 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes
08/02/2023, 14:40:44 - Dheeraj: You can use any of the online websites which print JSON in a prettier way, that would help you look at the data stored in the update-center more clearly.
08/02/2023, 14:51:31 - Dheeraj: Are you sure? we are not "calling update-center using updateCenter.Plugin" on Line 49. `....updateCenter.Plugin` is the **type** of `updateCenterPlugin` variable.


08/02/2023, 14:59:56 - Dheeraj: might be something fishy going on in your IDE, but have you tried using a debugger? that would help answer a lot of your questions.

so basically you removed line 51 and started rewriting word by word and not getting suggestions for `getDetails()` after `plugin.`? i wouldn't worry too much about it, maybe its just a flaky behavior of your IDE.
08/02/2023, 15:06:53 - Jagruti: >so basically you removed line 51 and started rewriting word by word and not getting suggestions for getDetails() after plugin.

Yes I did just that. 

If IDE does not prompt it gets a little difficult in understanding. 
08/02/2023, 15:07:20 - Jagruti: It did not prompt for `getDetails()` after `=`
08/02/2023, 15:10:49 - Dheeraj: maybe you need to enable code completion in your IDE
08/02/2023, 15:13:00 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please note that what I asked was a probe and you are for the moment speaking about Scoring process. Those are two different thing. Did you create the new probe first?

like should I be connecting to localhost port to open it up?
11/02/2023, 11:31:02 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): > first: .env file is supposed to be in the root directory, right?

Yes, the root of the project
11/02/2023, 11:31:34 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): > `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_NAME` takes my username, and `GITHUB_APP_ID` takes my the id no. displayed on the github app configuration page

That's right
11/02/2023, 11:32:44 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): > now how to accuss the front end/application?

It's accessible from localhost:8080 when the project is running

11/02/2023, 13:16:44 - Dheeraj: @MondalSayantan: I tried to answer your question, sending it here as a separate message because it would be useful for others too.

There are 4 general parts to writing a new probe in this project:

---------------

(A) Research and implement the probe logic:

I think your probe needs to search for files like "CONTRIBUTING.md" or "CONTRIBUTING.adoc" within the given plugin's repository and accordingly record the results. For this, go through the current list of the implemented probes and see how they do this, I think some of them might be closely related to this probe.

---------------

(B) Then integrate your probe with the probe engine: For this, you need to read the probe definition files of the ones which are currently present within the repo and see how they make use of the interface they are extending (notice extends Probe on each probe class).

---------------- 

(C) Write the scoring file for this probe:

Refer to other scoring files and think about how the result of this probe can be used here. Feel free to discuss this.

---------------- 

(D) Write tests for each file you add:

Very crucial. You need to write tests for the probe and scoring file. The best idea to know how is to look at the currently written tests.

----------------

General tip: Please feel free to have discussions on this channel about your approaches or doubts or anything. Also, maybe @alecharp can add something to this if I missed anything.
11/02/2023, 14:23:09 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Thank you @dheerajodha, this is really helpful :)
11/02/2023, 14:25:53 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): My approach, which is also Mark's idea, is to look into how the `jenkinsfile` probe is working and take a reference from there. The probe should give me a Boolean value which I can use for scoring

12/02/2023, 09:33:27 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I am trying to understand how the probe engine is getting the scm link, visiting the link and checking if files like `Jenkinsfile` are present. 

In `ProbeEngine.java`, I can see a line of code in the `runOn` method
`final ProbeResult result = probe.apply(plugin, probeContext);`
Which I think is doing the job of visiting the scm link and finding the files.

But in `Probe.java`, in class `Probe` there  are two methods
`public final ProbeResult apply(Plugin plugin, ProbeContext context) {  
    return doApply(plugin, context);  
}`
`protected abstract ProbeResult doApply(Plugin plugin, ProbeContext context);`
 which has a Java doc

     /**  
     * Perform the analyze on a plugin * * @param plugin the plugin on which the analyze is done  
     * @param context holder of information passed across the probes executed on a single plugin  
     * @return a ProbeResult representing the result of the analyze  
     */
 And in `JenkinsfileProbe.java`, the `doApply` method is overriden with the code

     Final Path repository = context.getScmRepository();
        try (Stream<Path> paths =  Files
        .find(repository, 1, (file, basicFileAttributes) ->  Files.isReadable(file) &&  "Jenkinsfile".equals(file.getFileName().toString()))
        ) {
        return paths.findFirst()
        .map(file ->  ProbeResult.success(key(), "Jenkinsfile found"))
        .orElseGet(() ->  ProbeResult.failure(key(), "No Jenkinsfile found"));

which is traversing the Files and finding if Jenkinsfile is present in it with a depth of 1.

In `ProbeContext` we are using this

     this.scmRepository = Files.createTempDirectory(pluginName);
which I think is creating a file system with the plugin name.

I am not able to figure out where we are actually visiting the scm link (The GitHub URL) and storing the information.

Also in Plugin.java,

    public Plugin addDetails(ProbeResult newProbeResult) {  
        this.details.compute(newProbeResult.id(), (s, previousProbeResult) -> {  
            return Objects.equals(previousProbeResult, newProbeResult) ? previousProbeResult : newProbeResult;  
      });  
     return this;}  
      
    public Plugin addDetails(Map<String, ProbeResult> details) {  
        details.values().forEach(this::addDetails);  
     return this;}
I am not able to understand how and where they are being used. But I think the previous probe results mean there is already information in the database related to the plugin, and we would add the new details if the information is stale

13/02/2023, 05:25:38 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): After more research, I think my answer lies in ProbeContext.java, in these lines of codes.

    public ProbeContext(String pluginName, UpdateCenter updateCenter) throws IOException {
        this.updateCenter = updateCenter;
        this.scmRepository = Files.createTempDirectory(pluginName);
    }

    public UpdateCenter getUpdateCenter() {
        return updateCenter;
    }

    public Path getScmRepository() {
        return scmRepository;
    }
`final Path repository = context.getScmRepository();`is providing us the complete repository (which means the Github Repo) needed for a probe.

I am not able to find where we are calling the constructor and setting the values.
13/02/2023, 05:28:32 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi @dheerajodha, could you please correct me where I am going wrong and also provide some hints?
13/02/2023, 11:57:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): The plugin code is cloned by the `LastCommitDateProbe` class. So be sure that your probe is executed after that one (see the  `@Order` on the probes class). Once it is cloned, the path to the repository is stored in the context. So you need to get the value from the context. be sure to check it's not `null` nor `invalid`.
13/02/2023, 12:01:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): once you have the path of the local clone of the plugin, you can explore it. Please see the GitHub documentation, as contributing guide can be in several places within a repository.
13/02/2023, 12:04:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): One major thing about what @dheerajodha said: you don't need to touch the code of the ProbeEngine to implement a new Probe. You need to implement the method of that class (`Probe`) accordingly to what your probe requires (needs a new release to have a different outcome? needs the source code of the plugin to have changed to have a different outcome?). 
13/02/2023, 12:05:55 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): You don't need to use the `addDetails` of `Plugin`, the `ProbeEngine` does that for you (if it is required). 
13/02/2023, 12:09:00 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the method `apply` is called by the `ProbeEngine` and was meant to be able to do some "cleanup" is required on all probe implementation without having to touch every single implementation. The method to implement is `doApply`. And because `apply` is `final` you cannot override it anyway.
13/02/2023, 17:04:58 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) , dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha)

Thank you for approving my latest PR.

I am interested in this idea for GSoC 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/add-probes-to-plugin-health-score/

Could you give me feedback in (based on my last PR) what areas I should work on to create a strong proposal?

I have been doing my research in the background. Trying to understand the code, watching old Jenkins videos, reading proposals, etc.

Please suggest some issues I should work on to understand the idea. Or what next steps should I follow.
13/02/2023, 17:29:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): We already have ideas for some probes, but it would be nice if in the proposal you can come up with your own idea, to show us you understand the project purpose. 
13/02/2023, 17:30:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Having tests and clear scenario of how probes should work, with external resources if you are using any, documentation links.
13/02/2023, 18:02:46 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): @dheerajodha do you have time to review https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/205?

16/02/2023, 16:15:24 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) 

I was thinking, can we add a new probe (apart from the ones mentioned in GSoC idea page)

that would test the popularity of the plugin based on how many times it has been downloaded or installed?
16/02/2023, 16:19:21 - Jagruti: Another probe could be:

- how often new bugs are created by the user
- how quickly they are resolved

Based on these parameters.

What do you think?
16/02/2023, 17:02:26 - Jagruti: In the Contributing to Open source doc. 

There is a there are three video links  that explain how to resolve security issues.

Can we create a probe that rates plugins based on the number of security issues? 
16/02/2023, 17:06:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): all those are good ideas. as Kris Stern said, I would like to keep as much of the GSoC projects idea as possible. So I would recommend not to implement any new probe until then.
16/02/2023, 17:09:40 - Jagruti: I was thinking of adding these ideas in my GSoC proposal. As you told me that I should add my ideas to showcase my understanding of the project. 
16/02/2023, 17:15:39 - Jagruti: Also in my proposal should I explain the logic of how I will build each probe? How it would be used? 
16/02/2023, 17:17:14 - Jagruti: One more thing before starting my proposal do you want me to pick any other issue? For better understanding of the project? 

I mean, do you think I can start with the proposal or I should work on a few more issues to strengthen my case? 
17/02/2023, 10:12:45 - Jagruti: I did this configuration. How do I make sure git uses different email ids in different directory. 
17/02/2023, 10:13:17 - Jagruti: I tried other links:

17/02/2023, 10:14:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): ok I didn't understand that. 
17/02/2023, 10:16:04 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the details of the implementation don't need to be part of the proposal but how you design it, how it would interact with other ones (needs to be executed before/after this probe), what value it offers and yes, how it could contribute to the score
17/02/2023, 10:17:08 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you don't need to work on any other issue for your proposal, but you are welcome to. be sure to not let that distract you from making your proposal that's all

Here it is. I have calculated values based on code. But now when I learned the difference between value and score I am confused. 
21/02/2023, 07:14:09 - Dheeraj: (deleted my previous message by mistake, hence typing it again)

This page: https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/probes/results is used to quickly look at the results of each probe which ran on ALL the plugins present in the update-center.

So, here the 1913 is the total number of plugins which we are currently running the probes on. If you check tomorrow or a week from now this number will change because maybe some plugin will get deprecated (and hence removed from update-center) or maybe some new plugins will get added.
21/02/2023, 07:16:49 - Dheeraj: For example, for the `jenkinsfile` probe, the probe results page (at `/probes/results`) informs us that from the total of 1913 Jenkins plugins, 1174 of them has a Jenkinsfile present in their repository.

Is this helpful?

21/02/2023, 07:27:56 - Dheeraj: > How do I understand the score calculation?

You can take a look at how the demo scores are calculated in my last year's proposal (as already shared by Kris in another thread). In my proposal wherever I've mentioned "weights" it means same as "coefficients" (which is the term we are using in our project). This will give you an idea on how we calculate the scores via the score calculation algorithm (which is just weighted average).

> How was the total score obtained?

Then move on to the code to understand how we  (Adrien) implemented this algorithm. The implementation shares similarity with how we calculated the probes values using the probe engine.
21/02/2023, 07:32:03 - Jagruti: In this table from dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) in the existing proposal I do not understand how are the values added in the Plugin 1, Plugin 2, Plugin 3 column for `Parent POM`, `Jenkinsfile` and other probes.

For `No. of open PRs` probe and `Average time to review PRs` it is evident that 500 and 50 is the max total value. How did the value 10/500, 17/500, 3/50. What does the value in the numerator mean here?
21/02/2023, 07:39:23 - Dheeraj: The "probe values' can be either boolean (0 or 1, signifying the presence of absence of something) or discrete (measuring the exact value of the probe like for "No. of open issues" the value can NOT be boolean, it could be something like 5 or 10 or 23, etc).

> I do not understand how are the values added in the Plugin 1, Plugin 2, Plugin 3 column for Parent POM, Jenkinsfile and other probes.

Those are random values. I added them to show evaluators how the final score can be calculated.
This table's main focus was not on the values, but on how the values can be used to get a final score.

> How did the value 10/500, 17/500, 3/50

I didn't get your question.

> What does the value in the numerator mean here?

Probe value.
21/02/2023, 07:43:16 - Dheeraj: > What is the difference between value and coefficient.

Key: Unique identification of a scoring implementation.
Value: Score value.
Coefficient: A value between 0 and 1 which signifies how strongly we want to apply the probe on a plugin while calculating its score.
21/02/2023, 08:48:39 - Jagruti: Thank you so much. This was really helpful. 
21/02/2023, 09:18:05 - Jagruti: I will make changes to the proposal based on this new understanding. 
21/02/2023, 11:06:14 - Dheeraj: I would also wait for Adrien to correct me if I'm spreading straight up incorrect information.
21/02/2023, 11:06:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): probe results are not like score value. they are just observation over the plugin setup. The message of the probe can carry value which are indication on the probe result. 
Score value are an interpretation of one or multiple probe result based on choice we made to represent the plugin health.
21/02/2023, 11:08:53 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): probe result status can be error (meaning the project couldn't test the probe correctly), failure (meaning the plugin don't have the requirement to validate the probe) or success (meaning the probe could test the plugin)
21/02/2023, 11:09:12 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the scoring implementations take probe result and determine based on its status and "message" content is required if the plugin is healthy or not. 
21/02/2023, 11:12:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm not sure I'm answering the question Jagruti ..
21/02/2023, 11:16:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the score of a plugin is the average score of all the scoring implementation applied to a plugin. those are using probe result to evaluate a plugin
21/02/2023, 11:42:15 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) this is my draft proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14URAapu7svkj1pgw3yoCybwn766Net9SZ9coC4zx7yg/edit#heading=h.3lp9fznrbf55

It is still work in work-in-progress. Could you give a look at the Implementation section? 


It will help me understand where I am going wrong? What things I have to work on. 
21/02/2023, 11:42:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it's in my todo list yes. I will have a look by the end of my day.
21/02/2023, 11:43:09 - Jagruti: Thank you so much.
21/02/2023, 13:59:13 - Jmm: I will have a look too
21/02/2023, 13:59:26 - Dheeraj: Me too
21/02/2023, 14:01:10 - Kris Stern: I will too, but later
21/02/2023, 15:09:44 - Jagruti: Thank you Jmm dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) Kris Stern it would mean a lot to me. 
21/02/2023, 15:36:12 - Jagruti: In my proposal I should have columns like: key, value, coefficient?
21/02/2023, 16:07:04 - Dheeraj: Short answer:
I think that would make sense.


Long answer:
The main aim of the proposal is to present a project plan in front of the evaluators. The plan should consist of in-depth details of what you aim to do this summer if given a chance. So, more detailed plan you write, the more easily the evaluators will be able to understand what you aim to do, how you to do, and also know about which parts of the project you actually understood, because we do not have much idea about what you understood and what you didn't. So, the aim is to convince the evaluators that you understood the project very well and present a very nice to-the-point plan on what you intend to work on this summer. So, if you're showing the coefficient and value of a scoring implementation, it would help us understood how important you think the given scoring implementation is. So, yes sure, feel free to add whatever you like to, it's YOUR proposal, customize it as per your liking to put forward your point strongly.

21/02/2023, 17:26:12 - Jagruti: Message deleted by gitter-badger (The Gitter Badger)
21/02/2023, 18:05:42 - Jagruti: To calculate score, each plugin is fetched from the database. Data like scm, release timestamp, version, plugin details are fetched from them.

The `Set<ScoreResult> details` type the `jsonb` data is fetched from the database.

The `ScoreResult` has three values: `key`, `value` and `coefficient` from the database.


The formula to calculate the score is: 
 
`sum` = `value` * `coefficient`
of all the elements in the `detail` list.

`coefficient` = `sum of all coefficents` in the `details` list.

`value` = Math.round(100 * (sum / coefficient));

is this understanding correct?

21/02/2023, 18:11:55 - Jagruti: Now, if I add `coefficient` and `score` column to  the table in `New additions to the existing probes`  section? Would that be sufficient implementation details based on Adrien comments? 
22/02/2023, 09:58:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > The Set\<ScoreResult> details type the jsonb data is fetched from the database.

Not the set of scoreresult mais de set of proberesult
22/02/2023, 09:59:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > is this understanding correct?

it is basically how you compute an average for your grades in school yes
22/02/2023, 10:02:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you don't add a column for the scores. everything is done in the Java class `Score`. When you add a new detail, it recompute the value of the score based on the set of scoreresults
22/02/2023, 10:04:00 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the implementation details in the scoring implementation is basically "how important should this implementation be compared to others" "what probe should this scoring implementation rely on to evaluate a plugin"
22/02/2023, 10:04:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the entire "score / value" management is done in the `ScoreEngine` which you probably won't have to  touch
22/02/2023, 10:22:22 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): do you want me to send you the test class I wrote for your pull request? 
22/02/2023, 10:50:32 - Sayantan Mondal: I am trying to write the test cases myself and I'll only be able to work on them from next week as my exams are from tomorrow. But I would love to have a look. Thanks alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier)
22/02/2023, 10:51:42 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Sayantan Mondal: please focus on your exams and on the proposal. I'll commit my test class in your pull request so that you can check it out when you have more time. good luck (for the exams)
22/02/2023, 10:52:29 - Sayantan Mondal: Thank you 😀

22/02/2023, 11:17:34 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

I have added a new Probe Scoring table in the `Implementation` section of my draft proposal.

Please do let me know if I have got the implementation details, scoring, order of execution right or not.
22/02/2023, 11:23:36 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier)Dheeraj: In the GSoC project ideas, I can see two ideas for this project - adding probes to the "Plugin Health Score" and displaying Plugin Health Scores. I understand the kind of proposal that is expected from us for the former idea, but I am not sure about the latter one. I am more inclined towards the second idea as I have a solid understanding of Reactjs and other frontend technologies, which I can see are requirements for it.

Could you please provide some hints on what is expected? Also, can we design a proposal that has both of these ideas together?
22/02/2023, 12:45:37 - Kris Stern: Sorry to barge in MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal) But acting as an org admin I just wanted to stress that you can have only one proposal for one project idea. 
22/02/2023, 12:48:44 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Understood
22/02/2023, 12:49:22 - Kris Stern: But you can of course submit two proposals for two project ideas
22/02/2023, 12:50:51 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): hi Sayantan Mondal are you working on this proposal?

if not i'd like to take it up, I was a bit busy the past week with acads and I see a lot has happened here. :')
22/02/2023, 12:51:31 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I'm active again though
22/02/2023, 13:11:10 - Kris Stern: Hi yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat) I think we can have more than one potential contributors writing a GSoC proposal for the same project idea, so there is no conflict there and according to Google no collaboration is allowed in preparing your proposals. 
22/02/2023, 13:11:46 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): great then!
I'll try and work on it.
22/02/2023, 13:14:34 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/193

have resumed working on this issue, so sorry for the week long inactivity.

so Dheeraj suggested for setting up `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON` to a more frequent value, I've changed the expression to fire the probe every 2 mins (just to observe if there are any changes in the probe results page). 

I still get 0/1889 for every probe, is that expected?
22/02/2023, 13:36:45 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): now, as far as the scores are concerned, from what I understand, they are being stored in a db.

my job is to just keep latest 5 of them and delete the rest of them from the db, right? 

taken cue from https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/repository/ScoreRepository.java
22/02/2023, 13:39:21 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): do tell me if I'm going the right way. 
22/02/2023, 13:40:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): correct direction
22/02/2023, 13:41:11 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): normally you shouldn't get 0/1889 on everything.
22/02/2023, 13:41:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): have you configured your GitHub App correctly? Are you sure you provided the correct key file (converted one)? 
22/02/2023, 13:42:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay!
and like, how to know which filed do I have to make changes (i.e. write the query to the db)?
22/02/2023, 13:42:54 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "have you configured your GitHub ..."> afaik yes, but I'll check and if needed redo the process to be sure
22/02/2023, 13:43:33 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): You should have to create a new class which should try to get all the scores for each plugins and delete the oldest ones
22/02/2023, 13:44:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): understood. working on it
22/02/2023, 13:44:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please note that if you haven't been working with database for very long, this might not be as friendly as it should be
22/02/2023, 13:46:08 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I have worked with dbs before, idk if that is sufficient to get this going. But ig I'll try it, hope I'm able to get the task done.
22/02/2023, 13:47:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): to try to answer the first questions Sayantan Mondal , the idea of this second project is to display the score of a plugin on its page in plugins.jenkins.io. the proposal should evaluate the state of the code in plugin health scoring project but also in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site and https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site-api as the GSoC project will have to contribute to those repositories as well
22/02/2023, 13:48:16 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it should be. 
22/02/2023, 13:48:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): let me know if you need more details
22/02/2023, 13:49:14 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): sure!
22/02/2023, 13:49:33 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and as Kris Stern said, don't hesitate to propose something for both GSoC project. 
22/02/2023, 17:02:57 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I still get 0/1889 for all probes, I re-did the Github app creation process :(
22/02/2023, 17:17:47 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): image.png (Media omitted)
22/02/2023, 17:18:06 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): image.png (Media omitted)
22/02/2023, 17:19:24 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the 2 tables, `plugins` and `scores` in my postgres container look like this. `0/1889` shows up because my score table is empty right?
22/02/2023, 17:22:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): scores != probe results.
22/02/2023, 17:23:17 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay. so the scores table is supposed to be empty?
22/02/2023, 17:23:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the 0/1889 is because non of the 1889 plugins have a successful probe result for the probe in questions (all of them)
22/02/2023, 17:23:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this is probably because the SCMLinkValidationProbe was not successful (many others depends on that)
22/02/2023, 17:24:48 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if that is also the case of the DeprecatedPluginProbe, please check that the ProbeEngine (PROBE_ENGINE_CRON env variable) was setup such as it ran at least once
22/02/2023, 17:26:59 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I've set `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON= 0 */2 * * * *` , the ProbeEngine is supposed to fire in every 2 mins, I suppose it must have run at least once
22/02/2023, 17:27:16 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): should I post my docker compose logs as a gist?
22/02/2023, 17:28:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): can you visualize the column `details` on the plugins table? is it empty (aka `{}`) or is there any json object?
22/02/2023, 17:28:53 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if so, please run the SQL script
```
UPDATE plugins
SET details = details::jsonb - 'scm';
```
22/02/2023, 17:29:35 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): this will remove the `scm` key from the details object in db so that the SCMLinkValidationProbe is ran again on the next try
22/02/2023, 17:30:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if still no `SUCCESS` status in the `details` object, then it means you haven't configured correctly the GitHubAPP
22/02/2023, 17:30:21 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): details column has `{}` empty json for every plugin
22/02/2023, 17:30:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): wait. you run everything in from the docker-compose?
22/02/2023, 17:30:44 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes
22/02/2023, 17:32:20 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I just checked the logs: I get a `NoSuchFileException` for my converted key, although the path for .env file is correctly pointing to the converted file
22/02/2023, 17:32:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it is likely that the `.pem` file set in GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH is not in the docker container
22/02/2023, 17:33:13 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes I suppose so
should I exec into the container and place the key there?
22/02/2023, 17:33:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so, you need to tweak the compose.yml file
22/02/2023, 17:33:30 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): right
22/02/2023, 17:34:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): add in the `app` service something like
```
volumes:
  - "./converted-github-app.pem:/app/converted-github-app.pem:ro"
```
(check the indentation so that it's in the `app` section)
22/02/2023, 17:35:44 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): `/app/converted-github-app.pem:ro` this to be replaced with the actual path to the converted key on my system right?
22/02/2023, 17:35:45 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): of course, change the first part of the volume (before the `:`) to match the local name of the file, and the second part of the volume to make the `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` env var
22/02/2023, 17:36:03 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): got ot
22/02/2023, 17:36:04 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): it*
22/02/2023, 17:36:10 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): no the opposite. `local : container`
22/02/2023, 17:37:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): you'll need to run the SQL script I posted before
22/02/2023, 17:39:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): ```
    volumes:
        - "/home/shreya/Downloads/CONVERTED_KEY.pem:/app/CONVERTED_KEY.pem:ro"
```

have done this.
22/02/2023, 17:39:09 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "you'll need to run the SQL scrip..."> right
22/02/2023, 17:39:51 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the first leg of the volume can be `./this-file-on-the-project-root-level`
22/02/2023, 17:41:56 - Dheeraj: yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I'm also curious about what you see on your console when you run `mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev`

That would also give us a hint of whether the probe engine executed or not.
22/02/2023, 17:42:19 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): <@alecharp-57757416c2f0db084a20d26d:gitter.im "yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the f..."> I didn't understand that completely. Should I move my converted key to the project root and then put this in the first leg of the volume?
22/02/2023, 17:43:22 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > I didn't understand that completely. Should I move my converted key to the project root and then put this in the first leg of the volume?

I generally find it easier to have the file within the project folder that's all
22/02/2023, 17:43:43 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): personal choice. you do as you like on your computer 
22/02/2023, 17:43:54 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay!
22/02/2023, 17:45:17 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): running the sql script, and then `mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev`, I'll post the result
22/02/2023, 17:46:34 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): be careful with the `mvn` command that the `.env` file is not used. so you need to manually `export POSTGRES_DB=xxx` for each variable
22/02/2023, 17:47:02 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and if you don't have a db running, you still need to run `docker compose up -d db` (that's what I do)
22/02/2023, 17:47:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): ^ this method might not seem like the easiest, but it's quick to get feedback when you are implementing something new.
22/02/2023, 17:51:53 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay, so I ran the sql script. I still get an empty json in the details column
22/02/2023, 17:55:52 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): that is, I need to pass env varfiables in the command line itself?

`mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -D<variable>=<value>` like this?
22/02/2023, 17:56:19 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): wait for the probe engine to ran again
22/02/2023, 17:56:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): no you need to

22/02/2023, 18:53:34 - Kris Stern: Maybe it is a personal preference, but if the proposal is a lot more detailed / verbose it would be better. Because then there will be less margin of misunderstanding. Also, a mini-timeline for the different stages for the project progression would be ideal. 
22/02/2023, 18:54:41 - Kris Stern: Even though an accurate timeline would be unrealistic, a complete and detailed timeline to be approximately followed would tell us how knowledgeable you are with the project idea and how well you will be able to self-manage the project.

23/02/2023, 05:38:51 - Jagruti: In my proposal,

in the `open source contribution` section, I have only added the PR links of my contribution to Jenkins project. 

Shall I add the description and PR link of other projects too? It will be a long list that is why I have just mentioned their names. 

23/02/2023, 07:20:58 - Kris Stern: I used to do that when I was a potential contributor, it is more explanatory and I chose the more significant PR's to include.

I reviewed your Work-In-Progress proposal document. It looks great and well done. I made a few improvement or clarification suggestions. I'll review it again in a couple days (time for me to let it sync).
Continue the good work.
23/02/2023, 15:33:44 - Harsh Gupta: Dheeraj: what value we have to provide in `GET_CONTENT` env variable?
23/02/2023, 15:33:53 - Jagruti: Thank you so much for your review jmMeessen (Jean-Marc MEESSEN) 

I am adding all the points you have mentioned.

23/02/2023, 15:54:05 - Dheeraj: Where did you see this env variable?

All the required env vars are mentioned here: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/docs/.env.example
23/02/2023, 15:58:40 - Harsh Gupta: while going through https://github.com/Harsh3341/plugin-site/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md i findTo aid with development mode, an environment variable of GET_CONTENT is needed to force gatsby to pull down the slow wiki/github content for each plugin
23/02/2023, 16:10:37 - Dheeraj: oh, different project. I haven't tried building plugin-site, but I can figure that this var accepts a boolean input ("true" or "false"), where "true" value would fetch all the wiki/github related content of each plugin, and vice versa.

I'd pass a value of "true" in order to see plugin content locally. I hope someone will correct me if I'm wrong.
23/02/2023, 16:29:23 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): are there any resources to understand what is the difference between a probe and a score?
23/02/2023, 16:33:28 - Dheeraj: Related: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.adoc
23/02/2023, 16:36:36 - Dheeraj: alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I read your message somewhere on this channel where you mentioned that you're working on a big revamp of the documentation of this project. Can you please tell me more about what you're aiming to do?
23/02/2023, 16:36:59 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): not just the documentation

23/02/2023, 16:43:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes. 
23/02/2023, 16:44:05 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm adding a few things but because I'm breaking so many things, I'm waiting for the current active PR to be done because it let me handle the merge conflicts on my own
23/02/2023, 16:48:28 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): hi, there's a thread just a few messages above, I was setting up the project myself, and adrian helped me out. that could be helpful
23/02/2023, 16:50:33 - Kris Stern: Yeah Hrithik Goswami (batman005) Better to try the #jenkinsci_GSoC-Plugin_Health_Score:gitter.im channel
23/02/2023, 16:51:02 - Kris Stern: No problem
23/02/2023, 17:23:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if you are just starting, I encourage you to look at the documentation in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/docs
23/02/2023, 17:26:22 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/193

so I've written a small function to list the scores for the plugins now, but I'm confused as to how to test the function?
like should I write a test and check whether my function works as expected?

I've added it under the ScoreEngine
23/02/2023, 17:28:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): so, I would encourage you to look into the PluginRepositoryIT class (in test) or the PluginServiceIT or the ScoreServiceIT classes. 
23/02/2023, 17:29:54 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): my suggestion is to add manually scores into the database
23/02/2023, 17:30:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): to be fair, the actual deletion shouldn't be in ScoreEngine but ScoreEngine method should call the method which I think should be in ScoreService
23/02/2023, 17:37:12 - Shreya Bhagat: okay. Let me try it out after the jenkins gsoc meet
23/02/2023, 17:43:13 - Jagruti: Well, switching or no is your choice.

But if you are worried about compatibility, let me assure you that I am using Windows 11 too. And the project runs just fine in my system.
23/02/2023, 18:30:22 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): there is no environment requirement. just make sure you have Docker available
23/02/2023, 19:40:19 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I was going through both of the repos. I am not able to understand how the plugin site is using the plugin site api to get the data. On inspecting I can see that the data being fetched is coming from Algolia. Also, the API endpoint according to the URL given is plugins.jenkins.io/ which is also the URL for the frontend of the application. I am very confused

Kris Stern and Jean-March Meessen have been kind enough to suggest edits to my proposal. With their help I have completed all the sections of the proposals except the Implementation and the Timeline section.

You and Dheeraj being the developers, maintainers, and core mentors of the project, I cannot proceed unless you give me your feedback.

You had suggested some suggestions a few days ago, but I do not think you got the chance to go through the whole thing.

Just reminding you to review the proposal when you find time.

27/02/2023, 15:50:53 - lzeee: Hi, everyone~ I am Shize Gong,  a SDE from China. You can call my Gong. I use Java and Python as my main working language. The idea of Displaying of Plugin Health Scores attracts me. And I'm planing to apply for that project~

Feel sorry for  joining this channel after I have submitted a PR based on an old PR. I should join earlier and discuss how to deal with it.

But now, I'm a little stuck on what should I do before start writing a proposal. There are not many issues labled as beginner-friendly. And any advice will be appreciated!
27/02/2023, 15:57:55 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): contributing to this project is not mandatory to submit a GSoC proposal. If you have other contribution to share, put links in your proposal.
27/02/2023, 15:58:45 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the content of the proposal and your ability to illustrate your strength (other public contribution) are key
27/02/2023, 16:01:57 - lzeee: Ok, thanks for the guide, I think I can make some contributions in other communities.
27/02/2023, 16:02:22 - lzeee: I just read the historical talk in this channel and found them very helpful
27/02/2023, 16:03:32 - lzeee: Thanks again for all the guidance in this channel
27/02/2023, 16:06:43 - lzeee: alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): It occurred to me that there is a detail in the CONTTIBUTING document that is not accurate enough. It took me a long time to understand the version of yarn when setting up the development environment. Can I fine-tune this part of the document?
27/02/2023, 16:08:01 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): at this time in the process, it's better to focus on the proposal than on other contributions. the sooner you can share your proposal the better. 
27/02/2023, 16:08:48 - lzeee: ok, thank you for your advice~
27/02/2023, 16:14:16 - Dheeraj: Thanks for stepping up and welcome to the channel!

> It took me a long time to understand the version of yarn when setting up the development environment

I'm not sure if I understood what you're proposing to add. Because in the guide, the yarn version is clearly mentioned as `Yarn 3.2.4`. Can you elaborate?
27/02/2023, 16:19:06 - lzeee: Hi, I think the version number is a bit confusing for beginners like me, because when you install node.js, it comes with classic Yarn by default, and its version number is something like 1.11.20. In fact, the yarn used in this project refers to yarn berry, which is the second version of yarn. I tried to modify my version for several hours, and found that these are completely two sets of package manager.
27/02/2023, 16:20:42 - lzeee: Of course, for those who already know more about javascript development, this is really not a big problem

28/02/2023, 07:54:02 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) 


Thank you for reviewing the proposal.

I have two questions:

1) 2 of the proposed probes need to be excluded from the proposal. As one is  in-progress, and the other one is already implemented. 

Do you want to me to think of new probes. What else can I do to strengthen my proposal?

2) About the timeline, shall I write how many probes should be delivered each week? Along with scoring and testcases. How should I structure this part? 
28/02/2023, 10:05:57 - Harsh Gupta: Hi, Dhee alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier):    preparing my GSoC proposal for "Displaying Plugin Health Score" I figured out that Jenkins has a plugin site "[plugins.jenkins.io](http://plugins.jenkins.io/)" where we have to display the Health score of the plugin which will be fetched from the project “plugin health score” which you worked on last GSoC 2022.

Jenkins plugin site has it's own backend api repo which is “plugin-site-api” which handles the data for it's frontend. As of my idea till now I have to fetch data from the “plugin health score” DB through “plugin site API” through which data will be displayed in the main plugin site.

I have totally understood the frontend area of the project, facing some difficulties with the backend as I'm not much familiar with the java.

I took reference of Dheeraj:  last year proposal to understand his thought process for this implementation. I just wanted to know, am I going in a right idea path? or I need to change and understand something else
28/02/2023, 10:31:20 - Dheeraj: > As of my idea till now I have to fetch data from the “plugin health score” DB

You do not need to fetch scores from the DB, as there already exists an API, written by Adrien in plugin health score project, which returns the scores of each plugin. You can get the scores from there.
28/02/2023, 10:33:38 - Harsh Gupta: Got it means I have to update plugin site api to do that process and send it to the frontend?
28/02/2023, 10:45:23 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): for 1., if you have idea, even something that is not clearly defined
28/02/2023, 10:46:32 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): for 2.a. test cases is part of the implementation of the probes (and scoring processes), so they are not done until tested.
28/02/2023, 10:48:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): 2.b. I don't need a probes per week ratio, but how confident you are to deliver X probes in the first part of the GSoC. would you reserve time for maintenance. how do you prioritize implementations. etc. 
28/02/2023, 10:50:01 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): but also if you have moments (days or weeks) when you already know that you won't be available. again, this is not to control you, just so we are clear about time off. I won't be available for the 12weeks as I will take time off as well (but don't worry, someone will be there to mentor when I'm off)
28/02/2023, 11:08:58 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): or you can argue in your proposal that this is not needed and the `plugin-site` project (reactjs) can reach directly the api of the plugin-health-scoring project to display the scores
28/02/2023, 11:33:03 - Dheeraj: I'm sorry but I'm not sure what to suggest you here. For me, this didn't seem like a major problem...

> I tried to modify my version for several hours, and found that these are completely two sets of package manager.

were you able to finally get it working? if yes, then how?
28/02/2023, 12:02:31 - Anshuman Shukla joined the room

28/02/2023, 12:25:23 - Dheeraj: you're welcome!
28/02/2023, 13:01:11 - lzeee: yes it's working correctly.
28/02/2023, 13:01:52 - lzeee: In my opinion, it would be better to emphasize yarn berry or the second edition
28/02/2023, 15:00:46 - Jagruti: Thank you. I will add the all the points you have mentioned to the proposal. 
28/02/2023, 15:41:05 - Dheeraj: I'm curious to know what alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) thinks about this.
28/02/2023, 16:54:21 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): to be fair, the version is specified on the contributing guide but knowing how to install that tool is not on the project responsibility imo. you can find resources online to guide you on how to install each tools. 
28/02/2023, 16:54:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): it would be the same for Maven. The version is stated on the contributing guide, not how to install it.
02/03/2023, 07:38:02 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hello, is displaying of the plugin health scores in the "Plugin Manager" in the Web UI, in the scope of the project "Displaying of Plugin Health Scores"?
Also as per my understanding, the health scores are not published anywhere except for https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/. The whole idea is to do it from scratch. Could someone confirm this?
02/03/2023, 08:09:58 - lzeee: hi, I'm also working on this idea. This page helps: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/displaying_plugin_health_scores/
02/03/2023, 08:10:46 - lzeee: I think it means to display the score on this page: plugins.jenkins.io 
02/03/2023, 08:18:53 - Dheeraj: Yes that's right, thanks lzeee for pointing out.

Also, displaying of the plugin health scores in the "Plugin Manager" is NOT in the scope for this GSoC. Please read the "Expected outcomes" section in the link shared above.
02/03/2023, 10:16:22 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Plugin manager is a concept of Jenkins Core. 
That GSoC project is, as pointed out lzeee and Dheeraj, about adding details on plugins.jenkins.io
02/03/2023, 11:50:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Be careful if you have started any work on the project, there are a lot of changes that just happened. 
02/03/2023, 15:14:30 - Dheeraj: alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): do we want to add a CodeQL (to check for security flaws in code) and Hadolint linter (to ensure that we build/have best practice Docker images) workflows in the project repo?
02/03/2023, 15:25:59 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): we already have hadolint
02/03/2023, 15:26:26 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): codeql no. the community have another standard which I don't recall the name. 
02/03/2023, 15:26:50 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if we add a security scan tool, we'll use the one used by the community
02/03/2023, 15:32:20 - Dheeraj: that's nice
how are we using hadolint? at least not as a workflow I can tell
02/03/2023, 15:53:57 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes we are.
02/03/2023, 15:55:32 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): in the `Jenkinsfile`, there is a call to `buildDockerAndPublishImage` which is a function located in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/, and in that method there are calls to hadolint. See https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/blob/795f274601aa934c5c773d77cdd892a30d1a8bbe/vars/buildDockerAndPublishImage.groovy#L119-L138
02/03/2023, 17:50:37 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and I stand correct, CodeQL is used in the community. https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/security/scan/
02/03/2023, 17:50:51 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if you want to add the GHA, you're welcome to.

Coming to my query regarding the project idea [Displaying of Plugin Health Scores](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/displaying_plugin_health_scores/)

I interpreted and divided the high level idea of this project into two parts, please let me know if i missed something and got something wrong:

1. Fetching the plugin health scores
As Now i could think of two ways to get the plugin health scores:
a) Use the API's already written to fetch the json data (this would give real time data but might be slow)
b) Store the data in a database (which we already do using psql) then fetch the data from there by creating our own endpoints. Databases could be updated once in a while to keep the scores updated.
2. Rendering the plugin health scores at plugins.jenkins.io (this i have completely figured out 😊, though we could make some improvement in  the UI )
This again could be done in two ways:
a) Fetch the data in frontend react using fetch() or axios or something else (may be slow due unnecessary data fetched if our endpoints are not very distributed)
b) Use the same process as we currently use to render jenkins.plugin.io, fetching data from [here](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site-api) and then fetching data using graphql in our gatbsy app


I was going to write the proposal using this implementation but then it hit me why not try to implement it and get proof of concept, but got stuck during the initial build. I tried to troubleshoot using different development environments, checked version of dependencies, setup env and all other steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.adoc) multiple time but no luck there.


 **(screenshot is above) error is produced by maven failsafe plugin**

#### I had few other question related to this project idea ??

1. **How do we store the data and host the api's (I couldn't find where the endpoints are hosted and how it can be accessed anytime)**
2. **While connecting to api, what are security measures (do we get open endpoint that anyone can access or private one to accessed by authorised ip's only like jenkins.plugins.io or it's backend counterpart)**
3. **Why do we use github apps ( I read the documentation on it and I've gone through repo but couldn't connect the dots)**

Sorry, if it got so lengthy. I tried my best to resolve everything myself and the understand the whole project architecture.

03/03/2023, 12:39:03 - Dheeraj: Nice research! dipanshu

would you mind re-numbering your questions so that's its easy to answer? (I see two questions with "1." bullet).

I've tried answering your questions, hopefully you'd understand the mapping!
03/03/2023, 12:47:45 - Dheeraj: (1. a.) Sure, I think that's one of the acceptable/recommended approaches.

(1. b.) We already have an API endpoint written by Adrien that does precisely this.

(2. a.) Yes sure, I think this is one of the acceptable approaches to fetch the scores.

(2. b.) I haven't read the code of plugin-site-api but yes I think we can do it via plugin-site-api. It would be helpful if you could present the best possible way to do it in terms of cost of maintenance, speed, etc in your proposal.
03/03/2023, 12:57:51 - Dheeraj: (1) Did you get a chance to look at this PR? https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/169 . The endpoint to access the score is `/api/scores`

(2) I'd let Adrien answer this one.

The Health Scores for each plugin is calculated in their respective classes. Here is the package link: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/scores
04/03/2023, 08:47:32 - Jagruti: It is through cron jobs that these scores are updated.

> for 1., if you have idea, even something that is not clearly defined

Based on the your feedback, I have the following 5 new ideas added to my proposal in the "New probe ideas in this proposal" section:

- Rate a plugin based on code coverage
- Rate a plugin based on if the dependencies used are stable and downloaded from the MAVEN central
- Rate a plugin based on code quality
- Whether is adheres to best practices of coding standards
    - Is the code readable
    - How easy is it to maintain the code
- Rate the plugin based on error handling and logging capabilities
    - Is the error handling robust
    - Does the plugin logs all the errors and exceptions
    - Does the plugin handles errors without getting crashed
- Rate the plugin based on licensing
    - Is the plugin open source license such as GPL or MIT
    - Does it allow for free use and distribution


I have some vague implementation plan to build these probes. But am not sure if these probes would be helpful to the community.

What do you think about these probe ideas? I haven't added them in the order of execution and scoring section yet.
04/03/2023, 13:41:25 - Jagruti: Also, I have completed the "Timeline" section. Let me know what do you think. 
04/03/2023, 14:21:57 - Jagruti: Also, I wanted to ask, do I need add some code sample in my proposal? I saw last year's proposals and there were some code samples in a few of them.

Do you think my proposal needs them too? 
04/03/2023, 19:05:06 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi, I opened a PR in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site-api repository today, where zbynek (Zbynek Konecny) informed me that the repo might become obsolete soon.
If the repo is going to be obsolete, does that mean the plugin site is not using the services provided by this repo? Is there another repository or are we using another method altogether.
I am asking this because contributing to this repo is required for the 'Displaying of Plugin Health Scores' project

04/03/2023, 22:07:01 - dipanshu: MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Although there is way around it by directly fetching the API's written by alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) to the react app.

04/03/2023, 22:10:16 - dipanshu: I've read several accepted proposal including Dheeraj and others
They all seem to have some proof of concepts through Code. Although it has not be mentioned at GSoC website or Jenkins Guidline regarding the proposal.
I personally think it would be wise to include it .
Hope it helps.
05/03/2023, 04:52:45 - Kris Stern: dipanshu Sorry to interrupt, but as a GSoC org admin I would like to add this: Try not to comment on other people's thread in this way as to hijack the discussion. Better let the OP interact with the potential project mentors directly. If you would like to ask your own questions, please start a new thread. 
05/03/2023, 04:57:01 - Kris Stern: Jagruti: It really depends what kind of effect you are trying to achieve with your proposal. If the way you present your material does not require it you simply do not need to. 
05/03/2023, 05:05:37 - Kris Stern: I think your proposal in its current state is already very well formed, and adding code snippets may distract from your original design of it, unless you have new section to add where you will need to use some code snippets to demonstrate a technical detail. 
05/03/2023, 05:06:46 - Kris Stern: Hopefully alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) and even Dheeraj will have something new to add to your questions when they become available. 
05/03/2023, 05:13:21 - lzeee: Hi, alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) jleon33 (jleon33) Dheeraj Jmm Kris Stern 

I have made my draft propoal for the second idea 'Displaying of Plugin Health Scores'. Here  is the open document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b9y8zvJvU6KGHRakzuiGiNAqldX7pvqAx2zuA3H1DoY/edit?usp=sharing. 

This is still on working now, and I marked some apparent lacks with '//todo'. Next, I will continue to improve my understanding of the relevant systems and improve this draft proposal.

I know from the chat history that you all have full-time jobs so I will wait patiently for your comments and suggestions. Thank you very much for any comments and suggestions~
05/03/2023, 05:14:15 - Kris Stern: Thanks lzeee for the sharing! I will review it over the next few days and let you know.

05/03/2023, 11:50:27 - Dheeraj: Nice! Thanks lzeee for sharing your draft proposal with us. I read it once on a surface level and added some comments. I'll go through it again in upcoming days.
05/03/2023, 11:57:32 - lzeee: Dheeraj: Thank you for your comments. They are helpful. I will change some of the details.
05/03/2023, 12:05:20 - Dheeraj: Jagruti: It depends on what you're adding the code samples for. If you think the technical details for a given topic can be explained better via a code snippet then please go for it.

I've seen code snippets being present in lots of proposals. I wouldn't recommend adding code snippets just to show (like a preview) evaluators that you can code. I think it's useful for explaining an implementation idea that would otherwise require a lot of words if you're not including a code snippet.
05/03/2023, 12:46:17 - Jagruti: Thank you everyone for your suggestions.

Honestly, I don't think I need any code samples in my proposal. 

I just wanted to know if the mentors think I should add some code. 
05/03/2023, 13:17:51 - Jagruti: Hey lzeee 

Congratulations on your draft proposal. I have made some suggestions.

One thing I noticed you have not added any links to your previous open source contributions.

05/03/2023, 15:31:05 - Kris Stern: Hi lzeee I did review the more technical parts of the proposal once today, but it looks to me you may still need to spend a lot of time to make it more readable, since I observed there can be a lot of repetition in wording. 
05/03/2023, 15:32:39 - Kris Stern: Maybe alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) can offer some insights into how realistic and feasible your plans actually are. My opinions in this regard can be quite strong and I have refrained from putting this on the proposal as comments as a result.

06/03/2023, 04:47:29 - dipanshu: Query regarding "Displaying the health score"

Am i missing something or i just couldn't find the following file in the repo 

File path - core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/http/ScoreAPI.java

Related PR - [#169](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/169/files)

The whole directory "http" seems to be missing. [refer](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring)


06/03/2023, 06:20:15 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): You can find it here `war\src\main\java\io\jenkins\pluginhealth\scoring\http\ScoreAPI.java`

06/03/2023, 07:30:21 - dipanshu: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "On a general note, you can also ..."> Got it, Thanks for the tips.
06/03/2023, 10:54:17 - Dheeraj: > If the repo is going to be obsolete, does that mean the plugin site is not using the services provided by this repo?

That question is better suited for repo maintainers, and since Gavin already explained it in the PR comment, so yes plugin site will stop using this repo soon.

> Is there another repository or are we using another method altogether.

We already have an endpoint available in our repo that lists the scores of plugins. We can create more based on the needs. Those APIs can be consumed by the plugin-site to render health scores. This is one way.
06/03/2023, 15:59:26 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Understood. Thanks Dheeraj 
06/03/2023, 19:10:47 - Dheeraj: You're welcome!
07/03/2023, 10:20:47 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I was out. What is the problem here? Did you find the solution?
07/03/2023, 10:27:19 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): for question 2., for the moment, we have one API but for this particular GSoC idea, contributing new API is part of the implementation
07/03/2023, 10:27:46 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): for the private / public details, for the moment I don't think we should worry about this. there is no confidential details
07/03/2023, 10:27:52 - Kris Stern: Hi everyone who is interested in drafting a proposal for GSoC 2023, remember to use the suggested official template to draft your proposal(s): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIlPLXfLbFsvcaHFuwmH9_lSCVm9m6-SgNYTNAnSZpY/edit 
07/03/2023, 10:28:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): we might protect the API from DoS attack but that's all
07/03/2023, 10:28:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): also, storing the scores in a DB outside of the plugin-health-scoring is not a good idea.
07/03/2023, 10:31:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Rate a plugin based on if the dependencies used are stable and downloaded from the MAVEN central

dependencies for plugins are downloaded from repo.jenkins-ci.org not Maven Central.
07/03/2023, 10:32:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Rate a plugin based on code quality

How would you measure code quality? That is a interesting part of the proposal
07/03/2023, 10:32:57 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Rate a plugin based on code coverage

Code coverage values are already gathered but yes, not used in any scoring implementation for now.
07/03/2023, 10:33:40 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Whether is adheres to best practices of coding standardsIs the code readable
> . How easy is it to maintain the code

I like the idea, but I don't see how we can programmatically rate that
07/03/2023, 10:35:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > Does it allow for free use and distribution

Normally, this is part of the requirement to have the plugin distributed by the community (update-center). But we could "check" it's still a free to use / contribute license
07/03/2023, 10:39:52 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I agree with Kris, adding code is not mandatory. 
You can learn to code and to improve your code quality. It's part of what makes a successful GSoC experience imo. So showing that you can code is not required. 
07/03/2023, 10:47:46 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I wasn't aware of the decision. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Then, it's simple: plugin-site needs to be fetching scores from phs directly

08/03/2023, 13:23:06 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi, I have a question. Is the plugin data the same in the update centre and the plugin site, i.e are all the plugins displayed in plugin site also in the update centre and vice-versa?
08/03/2023, 14:20:11 - Harsh Gupta: Yes, the update center and plugin site both contain the same data there is a total of 1891 plugins in the update center and also 1891 plugins in the plugin site. 

Additional data for the plugin site is also fetched from another source 

Plugin information sources include:

•Jenkins Update Center

The main source of plugin data

•Jenkins Stats

Installation statistics

•Jenkins Wiki

Scrape wiki content

14/03/2023, 17:21:27 - Jagruti: Hey alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) , Dheeraj 

I was surfing the internet to get ideas about `Rate a plugin based on code quality` probe when

I came across the term `cyclomatic complexity`.

On researching more about this, I learnt that there are already existing tools:  SonarQube, JaCoCo and the [Eclipse Metrics plugin](https://github.com/qxo/eclipse-metrics-plugin) to check this.

I do not know if the plugins use these tools? 

Can I add these details as a part of implementation idea in my proposal and open it for for further discussion?

18/03/2023, 17:23:19 - Tabitha Mutiso: Hi Guys, my name is Tabitha, a Recent DevOps Graduate i would like to join this project, i Have worked with jenkins and indeed been fascinated if not blow away by its capabilities. the display of health plugin will be an amazing addition that would save both new and experienced developers in selecting plugins that will actually help them and save them the headache of knowing weather its good for them or not. Drafting my rough proposal and hoping that ill grow and get to connect with you guys. already loving the progress... all pointers and help is welcome

18/03/2023, 20:20:58 - prince-panwar (prince-panwar): hi guys am also drafting my proposal for the project adding probes to plugin Health Score Project  SO I request all mentors and fellow contributors to take a look at it and provide your valuable feedback https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKQPbFeivJa2MW61_NZa7P2O54ASYe-wkU6f_pZi2Mw/edit?usp=sharing
19/03/2023, 03:25:40 - Dheeraj: Hello Tabitha Mutiso, welcome to the channel!

When drafting proposals it's very important that we understand the project and its deliverables first, then we research and discuss more on how we aim to achieve those deliverables. So, I would say communication is the key here, so do not hesitate to reach out to us on this channel with your questions, in case you have any doubts.

You can watch this recording in order to understand about this program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_sTkGtTix8

And you can watch this recording to understand about the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqMHdAUy85U

If you like you can also start attending the weekly GSoC Office Hours which Jenkins Org Admins are conducting. That is an excellent platform to ask your questions directly. You can see the Jenkins Events and the Calendar at the bottom part of this page: https://www.jenkins.io/events/ in order to find out the meeting timings.
19/03/2023, 05:44:35 - Jagruti: Hey prince-panwar (prince-panwar) 

Congratulations on your proposal!

I noticed there are more than a few spelling and grammatical mistakes in your proposal.

I suggest you fix them before the mentors invest their time on your proposal. 

Google Doc is pointing it out in blue and red wavy underline. Feel free to run Grammarly or any other English grammar software.

You do not want the mentors to fix your spellings but review the technical part of the proposal.
19/03/2023, 05:55:54 - Dheeraj: I see you've posted a question for me here: https://community.jenkins.io/t/gsoc2023-project-idea-displaying-of-plugin-health-scores/5318/13?u=dheerajodha

> Hi Dheera Jodha, am good with UI/UX and enjoy creating interactive features. is it ok if I majorly focus on the look and feel of the displayed plugins’ health score? i.e majorly draft a proposal on the front end part of the project. your advice will be a great guide

Yes, we need people who are very much interested in UI/UX domain but please note that the project's deliverables also include working with the APIs, implementing filtering logic, etc. So, we'd expect the candidate to be comfortable with those areas too, and not just the frontend part of the project. You can read the project details here: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/displaying\_plugin\_health\_scores/
19/03/2023, 09:32:32 - Tabitha Mutiso: ow thank you Dheeraj am comfortable with all the above i wanted to get some clarification. will be submitting my proposal by end of business. eagerly looking forward to working on this project.

Thank you for all your valuable comments, I am improving my proposal recently.

I would like to ask a question. Because many of us have opened our draft proposals, but it seems that everyone has different understandings.

I am not sure whether the features in the proposal should be completely consistent with the design of the idea page? (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/displaying\_plugin\_health\_scores/) Or is it up to the applicant to modify and come up with their own design? I think that the pictures on the idea page are just for reference. I don't know if my understanding is right.
21/03/2023, 05:09:29 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): For my proposal of displaying of plugin health scores, I was thinking of a stretch goal which involves comparing of two (or more) plugins. Comparison means comparing health scores, results of probes run etc. like one plugin might not have Contributing Guidelines and the other plugin might have it. This is somewhat like comparing feature of two mobile phones. It can be extended  further to include information such  as the number of install etc. Helps the user to **quickly** identify which area a plugin might be lacking relative to another similar plugin.
Kris Stern left some valuable comments on my proposal regarding this, but I want to have a more thorough discussion here before discarding this idea.
alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) Dheeraj Kris Stern Jmm  I would really like your comments here on this.
21/03/2023, 09:21:49 - Dheeraj: The prototype attached in the idea page is designed by jleon33 (jleon33) and yes it is there just for reference but it's a pretty good reference which might pose as a strong candidate when we're actually building the UI. So, to answer your question, if you have some more creative ideas for the way we can display scores then please feel free to share them in your proposal. It is always great to have new ideas from another pair of eyes :-)
21/03/2023, 09:30:12 - Dheeraj: That's a good question!

One question: why would a user want to compare the probeResults of 2 "different" plugins, which serve two entirely different functions?

My knowledge of Jenkins plugins is limited, but afaik 1800+ plugins are extending Jenkins to solve 1800+ problems each (with some exceptions I think).

For example, a user is looking for a plugin that can perform task X, and there's only 1 plugin that can help the user to perform this task. In this case, the user is less likely to use this "comparison" functionality as they don't have any choices other than this 1 plugin.

Tagging jleon33 (jleon33), in case he has some insights on this as well.
21/03/2023, 09:35:35 - lzeee: Thank you for your reply, I will consider adding some of my ideas based on the original design.
21/03/2023, 10:18:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > afaik 1800+ plugins are extending Jenkins to solve 1800+ problems each (with some exceptions I think).

Not really. We have some duplicate
21/03/2023, 10:19:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): look at the docker related plugins. there are a few of them
21/03/2023, 10:41:21 - Dheeraj: Feel free to start a new thread to discuss this.
21/03/2023, 10:42:02 - Dheeraj: nice, then it'd be interesting

21/03/2023, 17:06:19 - lzeee: Hi, I'd like to inform you that I have made some updates to the design of the display of the plugin health score on the frontend. I have provided detailed explanations of the components and display logic in the implementation section.

I wanted to request a final review of the technical aspect of [my proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14URAapu7svkj1pgw3yoCybwn766Net9SZ9coC4zx7yg/edit#) from alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) Dheeraj whenever it is possible.
24/03/2023, 07:18:30 - Dheeraj: Thanks for your patience Jagruti 
I'll be sure to give it a review this weekend.
25/03/2023, 12:08:09 - Rishi Raj Singh joined the room
25/03/2023, 15:18:33 - Jagruti: Hi everyone,

I had two questions:

1) How do I fetch plugin version from: https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-user-vars-plugin/releases/ into the code for **"Last plugin release date probe**"?
    - Do I have to build a new API?

2) For **Compare the existing parent “pom.xml” to the latest one probe** how do I get the latest version of the plugin pom 
    - Do I have to read the current version from the file at: https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/releases/?

 
25/03/2023, 16:13:16 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny): the best source of latest plugin versions is https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json which is AFAIK already used for other probes, no need to build new APIs
25/03/2023, 16:20:29 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny): for the latest plugin POM you can maybe check GitHub API documentation, though it's also worth considering getting it from Artifactory directly (in theory it's possible that a release is visible on GitHub but wasn't pushed to Artifactory or vice versa)
25/03/2023, 19:03:17 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

Do you think I should explain about each probe I am proposing? 

An introduction and its advantages in 2-3   lines?
25/03/2023, 19:08:36 - Jagruti: Or are the details in my proposal convincing -  that why this probe will be beneficial?
25/03/2023, 19:21:46 - Jagruti: Did you mean this artifactory: https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory/?
25/03/2023, 23:23:31 - Kris Stern: I personally think adding a few lines to describe each probe would be a very good idea 
25/03/2023, 23:25:39 - Kris Stern: Hi Jagruti I think Adrien may be still busy at the moment 
26/03/2023, 04:24:51 - Jagruti: I will add them. Thanks. 
26/03/2023, 05:07:07 - Kris Stern: 👌
26/03/2023, 05:30:15 - Jagruti: Thank you for your kind consideration Dheeraj and Kris Stern .

zbynek (Zbynek Konecny) [commented](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14URAapu7svkj1pgw3yoCybwn766Net9SZ9coC4zx7yg/edit?disco=AAAAtfN2yhw) on the proposal that  instead of implementing these tools, I should whether they are configured in CI.

I am going ahead with the idea. 

Other reviews and suggestions are welcome too.
26/03/2023, 06:44:30 - Kris Stern: 👍️
26/03/2023, 13:16:00 - Jagruti: Is this information correct? 

List of plugins are available in the `plugin` key. The last release date  is stored in the `buildDate` key.

This is what I have understood. 


26/03/2023, 14:50:29 - Jagruti: Using GitHub API, I can use this URL syntax:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>/<BRANCH>/path/to/pom.xml
```

Example:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/msbuild-plugin/master/pom.xml

26/03/2023, 14:50:55 - Jagruti: What about the artifact url? How should I create one for each plugin?
26/03/2023, 14:51:19 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny): no, I meant https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/ui/packages
26/03/2023, 14:55:44 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny): for Java code that interacts with it you can check https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/blob/master/src/main/java/io/jenkins/update_center/ArtifactoryRepositoryImpl.java -- it's responsible for fetching the latest release of plugins. Fetching the latest release of parent POM may be done in similar way 
26/03/2023, 16:16:32 - zbynek (Zbynek Konecny): yep, though buildDate is just human-readable version of releaseTimestamp which is easier to parse
27/03/2023, 18:58:32 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

I have updated the technical part of the proposal based on recent feedbacks. 

I would like to request a review.

I understand it might not be possible to review the whole proposal. 

I will be grateful even if you review the technical part. 

Here is the link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14URAapu7svkj1pgw3yoCybwn766Net9SZ9coC4zx7yg/edit#
28/03/2023, 12:58:05 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

Does the following point qualify for "Major Challenges Foreseen" section?

It may be challenging to stay updated with all the changes and updates made to plugins as they progress. Probes are developed based on a  plugin’s data.  If a new criterion is added to a plugin and the maintainer of the Plugin Health Score is not aware of the new criterion, a probe for the same will not be developed. As a result the plugin won't be rated for the new criteria.
28/03/2023, 15:43:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): do you mean that, for example, new plugins are now required to have the CodeQL check but Plugin Health Scoring project doesn't have a probe for this? 
28/03/2023, 15:44:37 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): if so, my answer is the same as for any open source project: PHS maintainers have to keep up to date on what is expected by the Jenkins admins from plugin maintainers. 
28/03/2023, 15:45:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): like plugins maintainers have to keep up to date with latest changes in Jenkins Core and Jenkins API
28/03/2023, 16:11:09 - Jagruti: > do you mean that, for example, new plugins are now required to have the CodeQL ....

Yes. That's what I meant. 
28/03/2023, 16:11:21 - Jagruti: In that case I will remove this challenge. 
28/03/2023, 16:11:42 - Jagruti: Do you think I should think of few more unforeseen challenges?
28/03/2023, 16:12:12 - Jagruti: Thank you for reviewing. 
28/03/2023, 16:14:06 - Jagruti: I also wanted to confirm,

does the UpdateCenter have all the the information from this URL: https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json about all the plugins?


28/03/2023, 17:01:17 - Jagruti: Is the following statement true:

Plugin release date is available to be retrieved from the ProbeContext in UpdateCenter.
28/03/2023, 17:29:36 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I don't see any other unforeseen problem. that's the problem ;) 
28/03/2023, 18:18:04 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

To build "Licensing Probe", this was my original idea:

> Every readme file of an open-source repository has a License heading. 

> Look for common license keywords in the file.

> Alternatively, we can also implement, and get the license for a repository API.

28/03/2023, 18:18:52 - Jagruti: Recently [Adrien commented](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14URAapu7svkj1pgw3yoCybwn766Net9SZ9coC4zx7yg/edit?disco=AAAAt4e2laE) that this not a good idea as the file structures are different.
28/03/2023, 18:20:59 - Jagruti: To fetch the license information from a plugin, 

Alternative solution I can think of is to check if whether "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.txt" or "LICENSE.md" exists. 

I observed that these files do not exists in all the repositories. 
28/03/2023, 18:22:44 - Jagruti: Could someone suggest an API or something similar where the license information about a plugin is always available?
28/03/2023, 18:58:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): plugins can inherit the license from the parent-pom, however I don't know how legal this is
29/03/2023, 06:41:44 - Dheeraj: > does the UpdateCenter have all the the information from this URL: https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json about all the plugins?

thats a big statement. depends on what youre looking for. the update center doesnt contain everything related to a plugin.
29/03/2023, 06:53:48 - Jagruti: It does contain plugin release date, right? 
29/03/2023, 06:54:52 - Jagruti: I will add this in the proposal and delete my idea.
29/03/2023, 08:29:03 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,


I have made the changes based on yesterday's review. 

It would be great if the mentors could approve the changes and let me know if I should submit the proposal on the GSoC portal. 
29/03/2023, 17:02:25 - Kris Stern: I have done a (my) final review of your draft proposal, feel free to update as suggested, and submit your application when you feel comfortable in doing so. But please don't wait until the last day to submit to avoid any unpleasant surprises. Remember you can always resubmit after a first submission. 
29/03/2023, 17:21:34 - Jagruti: Thank you for reviewing my proposal. Your suggestions have always been helpful.

I will do as you suggested. Submit a proposal and now. And update it later if required. 
29/03/2023, 17:23:52 - Kris Stern: Okay 👍️ Sounds good
29/03/2023, 18:30:33 - Jagruti: I have submitted the proposal on the GSoC portal. 
30/03/2023, 05:38:00 - Dheeraj: I don't see any mention of plugin release date in ProbeContext.java file here: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/probes/ProbeContext.java
30/03/2023, 05:43:32 - Dheeraj: but it can be modified to contain release date of each plugin, but it needs to be first fetched from the Update Center.
30/03/2023, 06:04:54 - Jagruti: I will add in the proposal that it needs to be modified to fetch the release date from Update Center. 

Thanks you :)
30/03/2023, 17:22:57 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): (sorry, I didn't see the message before) yes this is true. Last release timestamp is coming from the update-center
30/03/2023, 17:23:09 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): update-center is already present in the ProbeContext
30/03/2023, 17:24:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): there are other ways I think we can do that. like https://updates.jenkins.io/stable/ has some details we can parse
30/03/2023, 17:25:53 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the plugin release date is in the update-center
30/03/2023, 17:26:16 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/model/updatecenter/Plugin.java
30/03/2023, 17:26:28 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): is used to parse the update-center.actual.json for example
30/03/2023, 17:30:27 - Jagruti: Shall I add this as an alternative idea?
30/03/2023, 17:34:37 - Jagruti: So I do not need to modify anything now? 
30/03/2023, 17:48:38 - Kris Stern: To me at least it is better have a preferred way, plus maybe a backup.

01/04/2023, 08:55:37 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

Recently, Bruno (one of the GSoC mentors) [made an interesting observation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14URAapu7svkj1pgw3yoCybwn766Net9SZ9coC4zx7yg/edit?disco=AAAAuXEKX_Y)  on my proposal.

He asked the following question regarding **Plugin Dependency Probe**

> Would you have an example of a plugin that depends on another plugin not hosted on the official repository?

I went through pom files in popular plugins and each one of them have `org.jenkins-ci.plugins` as their parent.

My question is:

1. Would this probe be really useful? Do I need to make some modifications?
2. Is there an easier way to find the answer of Bruno's question?
01/04/2023, 09:24:19 - Harsh Gupta: Hey vaibhavsingh79: apart from GSoc2023, you can start to know about Jenkins from https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ there are various projects through which you can get to know how Jenkins is working, and also instructions for newcomers are present there, rest you can start contributing and can ask queries in Jenkins Gitter or community forum.
01/04/2023, 09:49:21 - Jagruti: Also there are many open source events hosted around the year. You can participate in them.

01/04/2023, 10:29:55 - Kris Stern: From my knowledge I suspect Bruno's observation is probably right: Due to the current security setup all dependencies are supposed to have been installed from the proper official repositories. 
01/04/2023, 10:30:43 - Jagruti: Should I remove this probe?
01/04/2023, 10:31:02 - Jagruti: Can I modify it in some way?
01/04/2023, 10:32:54 - Kris Stern: You can check for any vulnerabilities reported of a dependency I think. 
01/04/2023, 10:34:18 - Jagruti: To check those vulnerabilities I should read the warning and errors in the log files?
01/04/2023, 10:38:36 - Jagruti: Adrien did ask me to remove a probe which he thought was not required. But he didn't comment anything about this one.

I hope he finds time to give his opinion on this.
01/04/2023, 10:45:24 - Kris Stern: This may help: https://javadoc.jenkins.io/jenkins/security/UpdateSiteWarningsMonitor.html#getActivePluginWarningsByPlugin--
01/04/2023, 10:48:54 - Kris Stern: Or you can try using with the [plugin-installation-manager-tool](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool) as a command like the below:

```
java -jar jenkins-plugin-manager-*.jar --war /your/path/to/jenkins.war --plugins delivery-pipeline-plugin:1.3.2 deployit-plugin --view-security-warnings
```
01/04/2023, 15:24:43 - Kris Stern: My opinion is do not remove this probe, but instead add details to it. 
01/04/2023, 15:30:34 - Jagruti: Shall I rename the probe? 
01/04/2023, 15:30:54 - Jagruti: I have renamed it to: `Plugin Dependency Vulnerability Check Probe`
01/04/2023, 15:32:05 - Kris Stern: Sure, that sounds like a good idea
01/04/2023, 15:32:58 - Kris Stern: I think you may want to include some code snippet or references to Jenkins doc for this one. 
01/04/2023, 15:33:31 - Jagruti: I have added some code. But is in the table. The formatting is not so good. 
01/04/2023, 15:37:19 - Kris Stern: Maybe you could put it at the bottom of the table as a note
01/04/2023, 15:38:11 - Jagruti: I will do that. Thanks for the idea.
01/04/2023, 15:38:39 - Kris Stern: You are welcome! 
01/04/2023, 16:09:42 - vaibhavsingh79: I'm also targeting GSOC 2023...so any sort of suggestions are welcome and I'll try my best to stay active and contribute ...thanks for the help
01/04/2023, 16:15:16 - Kris Stern: You can start by preparing a proposal for  the [Add probes to "Plugin Health Score" ](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/add-probes-to-plugin-health-score/) project idea, but if you are interested in other ideas, you are welcome to submit proposals for these too, but this channel would not be the right one for you. Try #jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im instead.
01/04/2023, 16:15:57 - Kris Stern: The application preparation guide is available at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/. 
01/04/2023, 17:28:34 - Jagruti: Hey Kris Stern

`KnownSecurityVulnerabilityProbe` already exists.

It has the following description:

`Detects if a given plugin has a public security vulnerability advertised in a security advisory.`

Would the probe I am proposing be different?
01/04/2023, 17:30:48 - Kris Stern: Yeah, I see it here too: https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/probes
01/04/2023, 17:31:34 - Jagruti: What shall I do now?
01/04/2023, 17:31:52 - Jagruti: I saw this after adding new details 
01/04/2023, 17:34:21 - Kris Stern: I think we should avoid duplicating an already existing probe and try to come up with new probes. 
01/04/2023, 17:34:34 - Jagruti: True. 
01/04/2023, 17:34:57 - Kris Stern: I did find this Metrics plugin for Jenkins: https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics/
01/04/2023, 17:35:08 - Jagruti: I do not have any option other than removing this probe. 
01/04/2023, 17:35:51 - Kris Stern: Yeah, agree
01/04/2023, 17:36:12 - Jagruti: > I did find this Metrics plugin for Jenkins: https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics/

What do you suggest about this?
01/04/2023, 17:37:52 - Kris Stern: I am thinking we could use it at least as an idea for a new probe to check the health of the plugin based on the hardware resource consumption measured. 
01/04/2023, 17:38:12 - Kris Stern: But this sounds more like a stretch goal than a regular probe. 
01/04/2023, 17:38:48 - Jagruti: This is interesting idea 
01/04/2023, 17:38:57 - Jagruti: I shall propose it
01/04/2023, 17:39:21 - Kris Stern: Sure, if it helps
01/04/2023, 18:14:34 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

To build a probe to check the health of the plugin based on the hardware resource consumption measured. 

This plugin requires to be installed: https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics/

Is there I way to add the hardware information of each plugin in [update-center](https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json) and read it from there?
01/04/2023, 18:33:22 - Jagruti: Shall I propose idea that I will add it update-center and read those details from there?

But I do not know how details are added in update-center. 
01/04/2023, 18:59:16 - Kris Stern: I think we may need to involve the community on this. But the changes can be made at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2 it seems. 
01/04/2023, 19:01:23 - Kris Stern: Do you know how it currently works about the probe data now Jagruti? I am wondering if we could apply the same logic for the existing probe scores to these new hardware resource consumption metrics.
01/04/2023, 19:01:57 - Kris Stern: Would be more logical than to add details directly to the Update Center. 
01/04/2023, 19:03:15 - Jagruti: In the code the details are read from update center. Than is why I thought of this.
01/04/2023, 19:04:03 - Jagruti: See this thread: Kris Stern 

https://matrix.to/#/!VkECGUHmVHbfLeicii:gitter.im/$OBK2DHK3_aOi7xnbLWkQglnqJZCwzMuGiWYvqRZxuJI?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org
01/04/2023, 19:06:41 - Kris Stern: Oh, but that was for getting the plugin version. For each plugin we could obtain another probe score based on its hardware consumption like the other plugins listed here https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/probes. 
01/04/2023, 19:07:05 - Kris Stern: I thought we are using a Postgres database to store the info for now?
01/04/2023, 19:07:40 - Jagruti: I understood what you mean. 
01/04/2023, 19:07:58 - Kris Stern: I can tell what worries you too
01/04/2023, 19:08:14 - Kris Stern: Which is why this is an ideal candidate for a stretch goal
01/04/2023, 19:08:22 - Kris Stern: It will push your limits
01/04/2023, 19:11:43 - Jagruti: My proposal will now have 10 probes, after I removed that one. 

Is that fine? 
01/04/2023, 19:12:22 - Jagruti: > I can tell what worries you too

I will add this in stretch goal. It will require lot of discussion to choose the right way.
01/04/2023, 19:12:22 - Kris Stern: Think so, think that should be sufficient for a good start, unless alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) and Dheeraj think otherwise. 
01/04/2023, 19:13:18 - Jagruti: I will have 

- integration test and
- metrics probe

as stretch goal. 
02/04/2023, 07:04:26 - Jagruti: Hey everyone,

I am sharing the details of the metrics probe added in a new section named **stretch goal** in my proposal:

**Add a probe to check the metrics of the plugin based on the hardware consumption resource measured.**

- The credit of this idea goes to Kris Stern. He is one of the GSoC mentors.
- My motivation to work on this probe is:
    - Implementing this probe will certainly push my limits.
    - Rating plugins based on hardware consumption can improve performance, optimize resource usage, and reduce costs.
    - I will get to see the live reports and the benefit of the probe to the community almost immediately.
- Intro:
    - It would help us identify resource-intensive plugins.
    - Based on this data, resource allocation could be prioritized to optimize resources.
    - Avoiding or disabling plugins that consume a lot of resources when not in use will enhance the performance of Jenkins server.
- Benefits:
    - Making informed decisions about how to allocate hardware resources like CPU and memory, ensuring that these resources are efficiently used by plugins that are critical to CI/CD pipeline.
- Probe Details:
    - Probe implementation details and its scoring are to be discussed with the mentors.
02/04/2023, 14:35:06 - Jagruti: Hey Kris Stern 

Do you think Adrien will be available tomorrow to give his opinion? 
02/04/2023, 14:36:23 - Jagruti: I also wanted an opinion about this probe: **Bugs resolution time tracker probe**

Is the following way to collect data acceptable?


- Check how long it takes to open a PR for bugs.

- And what time period is required on average to merge the PR.



02/04/2023, 14:37:14 - Kris Stern: I am not sure, but I know he is trying hard to find time
02/04/2023, 14:38:48 - Kris Stern: This might be an idea that is good on paper but difficult to implement in practice. This is because sometimes if the tests does not cover certain bugs like those Null Pointer Exceptions, then it may take several tries before the bug can be patched. In that way it would be difficult to track the evolution of events. 
02/04/2023, 14:38:53 - Jagruti: No problem. I will wait until tomorrow to make the final submission.
02/04/2023, 14:39:17 - Kris Stern: So there may be multiple PR's for a single Issue. 
02/04/2023, 14:39:38 - Jagruti: Okay. Already added a noted that it might give some biased results. I will add this example as well.
02/04/2023, 14:39:57 - Kris Stern: But we could approach it naively and measure only the time between the bug report and the first pull request submitted to patch.
02/04/2023, 14:41:32 - Jagruti: We can do that and evolve it later.
02/04/2023, 14:53:52 - Kris Stern: Yup, sounds good 👍️
02/04/2023, 14:59:23 - Kris Stern: Also we could define this measure either as a historical figure or as bounded within a moving but of fixed-length time window.
02/04/2023, 15:01:24 - Jagruti: Could you give an example of this? For better understanding?

By fixed-length you mean compare to 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days? 
02/04/2023, 15:02:09 - Jagruti: And  what do you mean by historical figure? Kris Stern 
02/04/2023, 15:03:33 - Kris Stern: If we come up with a formula for the probe we will need to consider the time over which to average all such individual bug patch times. 
02/04/2023, 15:03:55 - Kris Stern: So by saying historical we basically consider every one of these bug fixes. 
02/04/2023, 15:04:50 - Kris Stern: But if we have a moving time window of say 1 year or even a quarter, then this number would have more relevance and less "historical" baggage. 
02/04/2023, 15:05:45 - Kris Stern: Would be good if you could think about how to construct the formulas to be used for the construction of the probes in my opinion. 
02/04/2023, 15:06:20 - Kris Stern: This shows you are not just coming up with raw ideas but are actually developing them actively.
02/04/2023, 15:06:48 - Kris Stern: They do not have to be 100% accurate at this point, but should at least inform your design of the probes. 
02/04/2023, 15:09:24 - Jagruti: Thank you. I will share the formula here. 
02/04/2023, 15:09:49 - Kris Stern: Okay 👍️
02/04/2023, 16:01:05 - Jagruti: `Average Patch Time = Total number of days required to patch bugs in the time window / Number of bugs patched in the time window`

and

`Average number of bugs patched = Total no of bugs resolved in the time window / Total no of bugs raised in the time window`


02/04/2023, 16:01:28 - Jagruti: Here, `time window` is 30 days. 
02/04/2023, 16:04:13 - Jagruti: `Total no of bugs patched in the time window` = 5

`Average patch time` = 30/5

In 30 days 6 bugs are patched every month.

`Average number of bugs patched` = 6/10  = 0.6

0.6\*100 = 60% of bugs are resolved in the time window (30 days).
02/04/2023, 16:04:33 - Jagruti: Does this makes sense to you Kris Stern ?
02/04/2023, 16:28:05 - Kris Stern: I think this makes sense, but remember to address the fetching of data from the database with a start time and an end time. 
02/04/2023, 16:28:24 - Kris Stern: So this maybe a SQL statement as an example. 
02/04/2023, 16:39:08 - Jagruti: If I add the statement: "Start time and end time would be fetched with the database" and ad the formulas would it be fine?

As far as I know data is stored in JSON format in Postgres. 


02/04/2023, 16:40:16 - Jagruti: I have less idea about Plugin Health Score's database. Could you tell me what kind of query should I write?
02/04/2023, 16:41:01 - Kris Stern: I think it is more like "We shall limit the data to be fetched by applying a start time and an end time with SQL/ORM framework"
02/04/2023, 16:41:35 - Kris Stern: The database used is Postgres I think, so it is definitely relational. 
02/04/2023, 16:42:04 - Jagruti: I meant what should be the select column name? 

02/04/2023, 16:42:13 - Kris Stern: This means you can interact with it using SQL statements or via a ORM indirectly. 
02/04/2023, 16:43:06 - Kris Stern: Do you remember the schema you tried to extract or someone tried to extract and share here previously?
02/04/2023, 16:43:15 - Jagruti: Would adding this statement along with the formulas would be sufficient Kris Stern 
02/04/2023, 16:43:41 - Kris Stern: Think so
02/04/2023, 16:43:42 - Jagruti: I extracted it once. By getting into docker containers. 
02/04/2023, 16:44:09 - Jagruti: But i do not remember sharing it. 
02/04/2023, 16:44:11 - Kris Stern: Yeah, you could try again to see what columns are there
02/04/2023, 16:44:17 - Jagruti: I will search in the chats though
02/04/2023, 16:44:24 - Jagruti: Thanks. 
02/04/2023, 16:48:21 - Kris Stern: Okay 👍️

02/04/2023, 18:31:19 - Jagruti: Hey Kris Stern I got the table structure. 

Could you guide me for the queries?
02/04/2023, 19:00:55 - Jagruti: For now, I have added this detail in theory. 
02/04/2023, 23:06:12 - Kris Stern: Jagruti: I think you can try something like:
```
SELECT details, value, plugin_id
FROM public.scores
WHERE computed_at BETWEEN '2023-03-01 00:00:00' AND CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```
02/04/2023, 23:06:31 - Kris Stern: 👍️
03/04/2023, 06:44:19 - Jagruti: Thanks. I have added this. 
03/04/2023, 10:06:26 - Kris Stern: Cool 😎
03/04/2023, 10:20:42 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I think you could use this probe to check the security issues on dependencies. this is a good idea from Kris. 
03/04/2023, 10:22:08 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I don't think this is feasible 
03/04/2023, 10:23:33 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): metrics won't be the same on each instance because it might depends on how you use the plugin. this also means users would have to send the data to some Jenkins community server, we would have to treat that data and then make it available to the update-center or to PHS. 
03/04/2023, 10:26:03 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I think the coding phases are less then 12weeks long. more than 10 probes is not possible IMO. 
03/04/2023, 10:31:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): the problem I have with this probe is: to measure the plugin hardware consumption, you need to run the plugin on a real and used Jenkins instance. This most likely means a users' instance. So we would have to gather the data from instances we don't control. We would also need to make sure the metrics plugin is installed, we would have to expend the plugin to make it send (if agreed by users) to a Jenkins server, where the data would have been anonymized, and so on.

this is probably a good idea. (cc jleon33 (jleon33)) but not for GSoC 2023 as this is more a full time project. 
03/04/2023, 10:32:03 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I don't have any bandwidth on saturdays and sundays. 
03/04/2023, 10:37:40 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I'm lost, what is it you are trying to achieve with this query?
03/04/2023, 10:43:09 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): a score is not computed if the probes it is using haven't changed since the last time it as computed. So, this could be problematic for your query
03/04/2023, 10:50:40 - Jagruti: This query is for **Bugs resolution time tracker probe**
03/04/2023, 10:51:02 - Jagruti: I forgot to add its detail until yesterday alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) 
03/04/2023, 10:51:16 - Jagruti: Kris suggested that I add a formula and a query 
03/04/2023, 10:52:02 - Jagruti: I asked the question here: https://matrix.to/#/!VkECGUHmVHbfLeicii:gitter.im/$x38gm4NN3sFB7uKrFlu2Sx1nHLoUsMOqYUHooIpGMyI?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org


03/04/2023, 10:52:14 - Jagruti: Let me know what you think
03/04/2023, 10:55:20 - Kris Stern: Yeah, I think Adrien is right in that we will need to fetch the plugin data somehow not from the table in the existing Postgres table but instead from a table containing all the data with all the bug resolution times computed periodically... 
03/04/2023, 10:57:15 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): for this probe I have some concerns: we would need to list all the ticket of the plugin, know which ones are bugs (some are not but questions, enhancement requests, etc), then find those with PR attached because we don't want to parse all the PR to try to match them to issues. but that "attachment" might be complex. and what about plugins created at the beginning of the project, do we parse the 18yrs of development?
03/04/2023, 10:58:56 - Jagruti: > know which ones are bugs (some are not but questions, enhancement requests, etc)

This can be found out based on the type of ticket. I have added in the proposal that we need to take care of this. 
03/04/2023, 11:00:32 - Jagruti: > what about plugins created at the beginning of the project

About this, Kris yesterday calculating score based on time window. 

For example: We will only consider the bugs opened in past 30 days. How many issues are resolved. How many new issues are created. 
03/04/2023, 11:04:49 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > This can be found out based on the type of ticket

my point was that some are incorrectly labelled. 
03/04/2023, 11:05:05 - Jagruti: Agreed. 
03/04/2023, 11:05:13 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): > For example: We will only consider the bugs opened in past 30 days. How many issues are resolved. How many new issues are created.

ok I see. maybe 30days is not long enough for plugins 
03/04/2023, 11:05:45 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): good for Core and some plugins. but not for the vast majority of them.
03/04/2023, 11:05:48 - Jagruti: > ok I see. maybe 30days is not long enough for plugins

It was just an example. We may change the number days during implementation
03/04/2023, 11:07:16 - Jagruti: How shall I change the propose the query?
03/04/2023, 11:08:44 - Jagruti: About storing the bug tracking calculation? Shall I propose to create new table to store them?
03/04/2023, 11:12:31 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): IMO, the proposal are not exactly what will be implemented. they are guide and there purpose is to show mentors that you have looked at the project, you have understood it and you have thought about it. 
03/04/2023, 11:13:10 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): to be honest, I don't think having a table with a list of tickets, per plugin and a list of pr, per plugin is a good idea
03/04/2023, 11:13:17 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): we will have to debate that.
03/04/2023, 11:13:51 - Jagruti: Okay. I won't change anything then.
03/04/2023, 11:14:10 - Jagruti: We will discuss when the time comes.
03/04/2023, 11:14:29 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): please understand that I like seeing this in proposals, when you can show you see some limitations. 
03/04/2023, 11:15:08 - Jagruti: My proposal is with a lot of limitations. 
03/04/2023, 11:16:18 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): I don't expect the proposals to be the exact description of what will happened during the gsoc. maybe Kris Stern has a different take on this. 
I do like proposal with challenges, but with a good understanding of those challenges. that's all
03/04/2023, 11:17:25 - Kris Stern: Actually I agree... The proposal is only the starting point. The actual implementation may be very different from the original plan. 
03/04/2023, 11:17:34 - Jagruti: I have mentioned wherever I find that implementation is challenging. And for two probes I have explained in detail why it would be challenging. 
03/04/2023, 11:18:17 - Jagruti: There are total of 10 probes I am proposing. Some of them are difficult to implement. Do you think this is enough alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) 
03/04/2023, 11:18:30 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): yes it is. 
03/04/2023, 11:19:24 - Jagruti: Thank you for your help and guidancealecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier) , Kris Stern 
03/04/2023, 11:19:40 - Jagruti: Let me know if you want me to change anything. 
03/04/2023, 11:20:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): We will have other things to implement, which are not strictly related to the "adding probe" project description but are vital to the PHS project: bug fixes, performance improvement (the more probes we have the more issues the project will face, etc). So, you will be adding probes but we will have to deal with the side effect of that. 
03/04/2023, 11:20:38 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): (I said "we", please understand that it's "IF" you are selected).
03/04/2023, 11:21:00 - Jagruti: > (I said you, please understand that it's "IF" you are selected).

I understand this. 
03/04/2023, 11:23:11 - Jagruti: > ... which are not strictly related to the "adding probe" project description but are vital to the PHS project: bug fixes, performance improvement (the more probes we have the more issues the project will face, etc).  ...

This is interesting. I assumed GSoC meant sticking strictly to the proposal. 
03/04/2023, 11:24:03 - Kris Stern: Not really, it's more like a research proposal then a work proposal in industry. 
03/04/2023, 11:24:32 - Kris Stern: Even in industry things can change quite a bit according to client requests. 
03/04/2023, 11:26:31 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Clients never know what they want (that's my take on this point) so plans always change. but limitations seen during planning tend to be the only thing that is kept from the plan.
03/04/2023, 11:28:18 - Jagruti:  > Even in industry things can change quite a bit according to client requests. 

This always happens. 
03/04/2023, 11:32:41 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): have I answered all your questions Jagruti ?
03/04/2023, 11:34:18 - Jagruti: I just read your comment about 

"Add a probe to check the metrics of the plugin based on the hardware consumption resource measured."


03/04/2023, 11:34:44 - Jagruti: You do not want me to remove as stretch goal, do you? 
03/04/2023, 11:34:55 - Jagruti: Shall I add the points you have mentioned in the proposal?
03/04/2023, 11:36:27 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): keep it. but yes, show in the proposal that you see and understand limitations, where the data is coming from, how you would store them if you need to, etc.
03/04/2023, 11:39:08 - Jagruti: Thanks for your patience and answering all my questions alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier)
03/04/2023, 12:02:14 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): there is no problem. it's part of the mentoring so don't worry.
03/04/2023, 12:03:40 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): and, by answering questions, I can see what how you understood the project and I can figure out where I didn't document / explain enough the project. which helps me improve the project so it's really a win-win
03/04/2023, 12:04:54 - Jagruti: Thank you. I look forward to working with you. I learnt a lot in this process :)
03/04/2023, 12:06:06 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): Message deleted
03/04/2023, 12:06:39 - alecharp (Adrien Lecharpentier): to everyone proposing to gsoc project, please understand that we also have https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aprobe to consider so there is no really "minimal probes to have in the proposal".
