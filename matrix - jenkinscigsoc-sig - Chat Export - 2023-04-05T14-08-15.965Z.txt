02/12/2020, 04:29:30 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @HYWZ36 JDK 1.8.0_181 and Maven 3.5.4 are both badly outdated.  I use JDK 1.8.0_275 and Maven 3.6.3.
02/12/2020, 04:30:13 - @hywz36-5c0cd342d73408ce4fb16094:gitter.im: emmmÔºåwhat is your  Jenkins version?
02/12/2020, 04:30:24 - @hywz36-5c0cd342d73408ce4fb16094:gitter.im: Now I want to debug and analyze the core source code, not plugins.
02/12/2020, 04:31:35 - @hywz36-5c0cd342d73408ce4fb16094:gitter.im: Do you mean that you compile and debug any stable version of Jenkins in that environment?
02/12/2020, 05:04:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I was most recently working with Jenkins 2.267 in that environment.  I've used other Jenkins versions in that environment as well.
02/12/2020, 05:05:38 - @hywz36-5c0cd342d73408ce4fb16094:gitter.im: I may have some limitations on debugging, please.
02/12/2020, 05:05:52 - @hywz36-5c0cd342d73408ce4fb16094:gitter.im: 

I'm a student, using IntelliJ idea.

In my experience, debugging the core package needs to import the jar package for analysis, so I can't modify the code and observe the response information in real time. Therefore, I would like to consult you. If I use the plug-in debugging method and have the target version of Jenkins core source code, I can analyze the Jenkins core source code in real time. Is that right?
02/12/2020, 05:06:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Have you looked at the Jenkins developer documentation on IntelliJ at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/building/intellij/ ?

 I am facing this error. What should I change?
10/12/2020, 22:20:26 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @b18050 that image does not exist.  I don't recognize that as a source of a specific demo.  Have you used the instructions in https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/blob/master/README.adoc to confirm fundamental operations are working for you?
10/12/2020, 22:22:39 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There is a Dockerhub image repository at https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins4eval/jenkinsfile-runner/ that has been updated recently.  I don't see a cwp-demo in that repository, just the base Jenkinsfile runner images
11/12/2020, 04:24:38 - @b18050-5c11367fd73408ce4fb1bc88:gitter.im: Fundamental operations are working but with sudo command.

06/01/2021, 18:07:25 - @markyjackson-taulia-5bdaef83d73408ce4fad8576:gitter.im: @hp77-creator Bridge networking allows the use of docker CLI which is not within the image

07/01/2021, 01:01:12 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: currently in Jenkins for prividing REST API to users, is Jenkins using Spring to make the REST API?
07/01/2021, 09:06:26 - timja (Tim Jacomb): no, stapler, it's very dated and yuck for a rest api
07/01/2021, 09:10:38 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: Thanks Tim for telling me I will research about it now
and as Im trying to work on this project first Im trying to grab a deep understanding over REST API, and then OpenApi and then I will look in to this project idea again
currently learning about APi from freeCodeCamp.org
Im talking about this project idea - https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2021/project-ideas/automatic-spec-generator-for-jenkins-rest-api/
Hopefully Im taking steps in right direction

07/01/2021, 09:32:12 - timja (Tim Jacomb): right i see

10/01/2021, 21:46:24 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: Im trying to understand the project `Automatic Specification Generator for Jenkins REST API` from last wednesday meeting and I have alot of questions to ask regarding that
So should I drop my questions here in chat or preserve them for till next wednesday and then till then doing more and more research about my questions and futher more?
10/01/2021, 23:57:59 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Drop them here in the chat window.  Much better to allow async comments, questions, and answers

11/01/2021, 09:39:20 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: So Im trying to understand where I can research more start with something in the Specification generator that I have to extract the REST API from the sources and publish the REST API documentation, but in order to achieve this Im trying to understand How can I do this. For that I came across this video  `GSoC 2020 - REST API Specification Generator Project Discussion`  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06E1usE6j1Q 

and from here Oleg is trying to say that the first good step is to generate specifications using the Annnatations with the help of sezpoz with which I can capture annotations this is the one first scenario and other parts of a project where we are not using the annotations for that I have to complete analysis of How annotations works but as Oleg said to start with GET annotations specification generator first.
But on the other hand, Kristin who is the other potential mentor said that we have to ultimately generate Documentation using the OPEN API

So, my question is should I look into how I can generate GET specification using annotations for the first step or how I can use Swagger to autogenerate the documentation

with this, I'm a little confused that from now on where should I research more about

and sorry if my English is bad
Thanks

I watched the 13 Jan Meeting couple of times to understand where I can explore further in the REST API Specification generator and as Oleg said explore the Code Coverage Plugin
But I installed the Plugin and I don't know the use of it and trying to understand it
should I try to understand that plugin code base or read code about the pipeline documentation generator code? https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator.
but even tho after reading about the Plugin doc page still I don't have any idea what it is doing.
I want to explore the possibilities but that still seems quite unclear to me how to use that plugin in Jenkins

I have previously used Jenkins during my stint at NVIDIA and was always curious about the codebase and the automation potential of it. 
I have setup the basic environment and a couple of plugins to begin with and I plan to start contributing to the codebase (hopefully as a part of GSOC 2021 as well).
Anything which I need to keep in mind which is not there in the READMEs and other relevant links?
Thanks in advance! :)
02/02/2021, 01:15:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Welcome @abhisheklalwani .  The https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ pages outline how the Jenkins project interacts with Google Summer of Code.  Several suggestions for project ideas are at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2021/project-ideas/ .  https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/proposing-project-ideas/ describes how to submit your own project idea for discussion.

02/02/2021, 15:50:06 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: What does this step means in `pipeline-steps-doc-generator` Readme

02/02/2021, 16:12:06 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): In that pipeline steps doc generator  instruction, I believe that instruction allows the jenkins.io build step to use the result of the local steps generator program instead of reading the data from those remote sources
02/02/2021, 16:13:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): When I was running the steps generator a day or two ago, I didn't see any difference between adding that change or not adding that change.

In both cases, I saw changes from the modification I was making.  You may be able to ignore that entry in the README.
02/02/2021, 16:14:45 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you look at recent pull requests recently merged to that repository, you'll see several pull requests that I submitted and have merged to update dependencies and automate the dependency update process

02/02/2021, 18:22:09 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The piipeline steps doc generator likely detects things that are not quite perfect for what the generator expects.  I assume something similar will happen with the REST API generator as well

yeah it sounds so
03/02/2021, 16:20:19 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: There is some system issue from my side and I can't join the meet. I had a question or two. During my research of Plugin Installation manager tool, I migrated all the issues from JIRA to github and also solved a basic issue. My question is that in the project idea for GSoC, It is mentioned our aim is to improve the tool and In my course of migrating issues I found many corresponding to the improvement of tool. So, Should one include the solutions to those issues in the proposal or find even more improvements to add in the proposal?!
03/02/2021, 16:40:46 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: Message deleted
03/02/2021, 19:13:14 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think that first candidates are the existing proposed improvements because we are confident those have users that are interested in the improvement.  The git plugin project idea that I submitted is the third highest voted issue in Jenkins Jira.  No shame (for me) in choosing a project that users are willing to vote for that project idea.
03/02/2021, 19:14:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you detect other ideas, beyond those suggested by users, they are also worthy candidates to include in a proposal.  For example, users did not specifically suggest the git performance improvements we did in GSoC 2020, but they had expressed concerns about performance in many different ways.  We combined those different ideas into a project idea that became a project proposal and was then accepted as a project
03/02/2021, 20:29:15 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: Thanks @MarkEWaite, My concern in asking this question is like there might be a possibility of someone enabling any improvement before the GSoC period or before proposal review(as they are requested in issues and there are so many open source enthusiasts out there) and if I include an issue which is solved before review of proposal, that will be not fair with the organisation imo. What do you suggest in this case?
03/02/2021, 20:30:24 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If a specific idea is already implemented by the time the project is selected and starts, the mentors and the GSoC student work together to refine and clarify the scope to not include the already implemented part
03/02/2021, 20:31:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): We're allowed to adjust project plans as needed, even during the project.  There are some limits applied by GSoC rules, but we've not had an issue adjusting project definition as needed
03/02/2021, 21:03:09 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: Cool then, Thank you so much, Now I have one less thing to worry about :smile:

I went through the GSOC 2021 projects page on Jenkin's website, and the following projects piqued my interest: 
  - CloudEvents plugin for Jenkins
  - Plugin Installation Manager Tool Improvements

Reading the description, I got a gist of what is expected and I think I am competent enough to drive those projects to completion.
I would once again like to go through the QuickStart section of those two and try to start something before tomorrow's office hours üòÉ

10/02/2021, 16:03:29 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): It will likely be several hours before I can upload the recording to YouTube.  I'm hosting a Jenkins Online Meetup that starts in 60 minutes and am watching the Jenkins 2.263.4 release as it progresses through the delivery pipeline.  Those two things are likely to distract me from uploading the recording until near the end of my day.  If it is not available within 12 hours, ping me here to remind me.

12/02/2021, 16:27:48 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Hm, I don't see that error message when running with all the plugins.  The documentation is still generated, the stack traces are there for debugging.  It looks like the descriptors are missing and I don't know why right now.  The main class loaded though which is how they were even able to be queried in the first place.
12/02/2021, 16:28:39 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): I would have to dig more, but I know those are loaded correctly in the main job because the plugins are on separate pages.  It could be a race/timing thing but I'd have to dig at it.
12/02/2021, 16:48:42 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I wonder if there is something specific to Windows that causes the pipeline steps docs generator to behave differently.  Would you be willing to try the same steps in a Linux (Ubuntu or Debian) virtual machine running on your Windows computer?
12/02/2021, 16:49:21 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): We've seen cases where docs development is more complicated on Windows.  I wonder if this has a similar complication when running on Windows

15/02/2021, 13:45:35 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: same issue on Ubuntu same
16/02/2021, 09:46:42 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Ok, I'm looking to see if the update to the newer core has a race condition or if the PluginStrategy needs to be updated.  I don't really want to recommend downloading and pointing to all the plugins since it's large and not really worth it.  In the meantime, you can still try to see how a rest api step is defined in Jenkins and who knows, try getting a plugin with all its dependencies in a plugin folder so you can see how it works

Sorry for the spam, was trying to start a thread here :)
I wrote and extended a HelloWorld plugin (yayy for me) 

I wanted to know whether the following are the expected steps I should take for "CloudEvents plugin for Jenkins" project:
1. get familiar with cloudevents java sdk
2. write a plugin, where a buildstep would create a simple CloudEvent
  
16/02/2021, 18:03:53 - @adi10hero-5b408290d73408ce4f9fed5c:gitter.im: If yes, then I would like some help with selecting the right archetype while creating the plugin, I think it should be `global-configuration-plugin` but I may be way off 
17/02/2021, 15:34:07 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): @hellosagar just wanted to say I'm still looking at this in terms of debugging!  Since it doesn't happen with all the plugins installed, I'm leaning towards it being some classloader thing.  But I can see the documentation being created so I know that it's getting all the information about the plugin steps.  Again, for now I'd focus on trying to get together what makes a REST api step, and then where all the rest of the information (like help, the paths) would come from.
17/02/2021, 15:36:28 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Also!  Something else to look at would be https://swagger.io/specification/ -> openapi3.  There might be some tools you can take advantage of in terms of autogenerating that openapi doc which would make your life infinitesimally easier.
17/02/2021, 16:34:30 - @adi10hero-5b408290d73408ce4f9fed5c:gitter.im: @MarckK Firstly, my apologies for not joining the meet, got busy with some urgent college work, I had started working towards "CloudEvents plugin for Jenkins" project and had a question ( I actually asked it as a reply to your message welcoming me, which is why, I guess, it was missed ), anyway here's  the message:

19/02/2021, 15:29:07 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): What does it mean to be a reference?  If it means being an organization admin for the GSoC efforts of the Kubesphere community, I don't have capacity to do that.

19/02/2021, 15:40:36 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The Jenkins GSoC application is being included with the Continuous Delivery Foundation submission.  I believe that Tara Hernandez of Google is submitting the application for the Continuous Delivery Foundation.  She and Kara de la Marck were working on the application yesterday.  I assume that they submitted it yesterday so that it would be in before the submission deadline.  It is now 14:40 UTC and the deadine is 19:00 UTC
19/02/2021, 15:41:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think that Kubesphere may need to submit a separate application.  I don't know that there is enough time for Kubesphere to be included in the CDF application.
19/02/2021, 15:42:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I don't have an email address for Tara Hernandez and Kara is out of the office today.

10/03/2021, 15:48:55 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: @oleg-nenashev where can I get links to different update centers? I visited https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/update-center.actual.json and https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json and their json format looks same, Like I don't know what are different keys that are provided from update centers so if you could give example links of any other UC which does not follow the https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json 's format?
10/03/2021, 16:46:39 - @marckk-56c77f3ce610378809c25b44:gitter.im: Hi all, as Jenkins will be participating in GSoC as part of the CDF GSoC organisation, we encourage you all to join the CDF slack and join channel #gsoc.

10/03/2021, 17:30:39 - kuro: I can see a #gsoc and #jenkins-x-gsoc channels

10/03/2021, 17:31:47 - @raghavgarg098-601a672c6da037398460f5cc:gitter.im: I have cloned the credentials-binding-plugin repository and successfully built it as a maven project using IntelliJ IDEA passing all the automated tests.I want to install some more more plugins but unable to install due to the (Warning: This plugin requires dependent plugins that require Jenkins 2.190.3 or newer. Jenkins will refuse to load the dependent plugins requiring a newer version of Jenkins, and in turn loading this plugin will fail).However I am able to do the same process with other plugins like git-plugin. Can someone help? Is this problem specific to credentials-binding plugin?
10/03/2021, 17:34:19 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: my bad, by default there were just 3 channels listed didn't know I had to add other channels or been a long time that I did not open slack smh, 
thanks @adi10hero:matrix.org ,
10/03/2021, 17:38:44 - kuro: Hahah no issues hp77-creator (hp77) 
10/03/2021, 17:43:06 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: Thanks, Kara. I'm also able to join the Slack channel now :)
10/03/2021, 18:33:17 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think you may want to set the jenkins.version property passed to maven to have a value like 2.264.3 .  Not sure how to do that with IntelliJ IDEA, but I suspect there are others that know how to do it.
10/03/2021, 18:34:12 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The default for `mvn hpi:run` is to run the minimum Jenkins version specified in the pom.xml file.  Setting jenkins.version will use the version you set
10/03/2021, 22:48:36 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): The easiest way would be to deploy your own update center with Juseppe: https://github.com/jenkinsci/juseppe
11/03/2021, 09:31:03 - @marckk-56c77f3ce610378809c25b44:gitter.im: Awesome! Glad you all have been able to join the CDF slack :) The #gsoc channel is the correct one for GSoC.  Definitely check out the other channels as well.  :)

12/03/2021, 18:08:15 - @niveditaprasad81_gitlab-601d22156da0373984612a54:gitter.im: Hello everyone! I am trying to design a proposal to help and solve the issue for : Git credentials binding for sh,bat and powershell.
Before sharing the first draft of the proposal, I wanted to share my assumptions. Please correct me if I am understanding it right and help me learn better:

Understanding of the problem:
1.We are trying to do two things here:
a)building two credentials  gitSshPrivateKey and gitUsernamePassword.

b) And this credentials will be implemented to the git plugins. This plugins will support CLI of git version like able to delete and create remote branch , push results.(in Java?)
Users can use git cli according to their choice like for single branch or recurse-submodules.                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Currently, in the multibranch pipeline we have one plugin of git that is we can add a repository URL.                                      
Thanks.
13/03/2021, 06:32:03 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: I am sorry but I don't understand much of what juseppe, is it a tool to create a enterprise update center? There is one flag JUSEPPE_BASE_URI which requires some company domain, I don't have any of those so i can't try this else I would have. Did you understand my previous doubt about the format? How is juseppe solving that? I am sorry if these doubts are too naive.
13/03/2021, 09:32:08 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): You can keep JUSEPPE_BASE_URI the default one, though you might want to change the port for testing purposes
13/03/2021, 13:57:18 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: I could get the docker up and running but for accessing update-center.json
13/03/2021, 13:57:20 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: there is some error
13/03/2021, 13:57:27 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: I have linked 80:8090

13/03/2021, 15:07:23 - rishabhBudhouliya (Rishabh Budhouliya): Hi Nivedita! As the [project page](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2021/project-ideas/git-credentials-binding-for-pipeline/)  mentions, the idea is to enable Jenkins users to execute authenticated git commands for a Pipeline. This will provide a greater degree of freedom w.r.t running git commands and to achieve that we want to use the concept of credential bindings. You can discuss more on the [git plugin channel](https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/git-plugin).

Also, I would recommend to look at the [newbie-friendly](https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=(component%3Dgit-plugin%20OR%20component%20%3D%20git-client-plugin)%20and%20labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly%20and%20status%20in%20(Open%2CReopened)) issues to familiarise yourself with the git plugin source code.

23/03/2021, 12:44:49 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): Hi! Sorry for the response delay. I will ping mentors to get the feedback. Note that the mailing list is generally a more reliable way of communication. CC @MarkEWaite

23/03/2021, 19:31:02 - @gayan17-5e8e8dbdd73408ce4fdfcb3f:gitter.im: So should I post it on mailing list ?
23/03/2021, 19:31:25 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, since we want to encourage feedback from others as well
23/03/2021, 19:31:39 - @gayan17-5e8e8dbdd73408ce4fdfcb3f:gitter.im: Okay sure.

24/03/2021, 17:36:40 - @jeffpearce-5aec8d4fd73408ce4f982473:gitter.im: I added some comments. Don't be discouraged by the amount - this is a good proposal.
24/03/2021, 17:39:48 - @jeffpearce-5aec8d4fd73408ce4f982473:gitter.im: One of the things I've noticed in past GSOC projects is that unit testing often comes later in the project. Have we considered encouraging (or requiring) an adequate level of unit tests with each PR?
24/03/2021, 17:40:46 - @jeffpearce-5aec8d4fd73408ce4f982473:gitter.im: At my company we require new repos to have 80% coverage at all times. The obvious argument is that having a high coverage doesn't mean anything - you can easily write tests that cover 100% but don't verify anything.
24/03/2021, 17:41:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I'm deeply opinionated about unit tests being a part of pull requests, even early pull requests.  I'll be encouraging automated tests 
24/03/2021, 17:41:14 - @jeffpearce-5aec8d4fd73408ce4f982473:gitter.im: Opinionated in which way :-)
24/03/2021, 17:41:50 - @jeffpearce-5aec8d4fd73408ce4f982473:gitter.im: I find focusing on tests early influences how I write code so it can be testable, so I tend to adopt things like dependency injection
24/03/2021, 17:44:06 - @jeffpearce-5aec8d4fd73408ce4f982473:gitter.im: Would anyone object to making some level of coverage mandatory for all GSoc project? Or is it better left to the mentors?
24/03/2021, 17:46:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Agreed.  The complications writing automated tests for Jenkins components are worth understanding and applying.  JenkinsRule, GitSampleRepoRule, and TemporaryFolderRule have all been very useful

I have been following the discussions here since last year's GSOC. I could not participate because I felt I needed to learn more. I enrolled and obtained a Udacity Nanodegree in DevOps. I really really want to contribute this year to the Jenkins project. Guidance would be so much appreciated. In the meantime, I tried signing up to CDF slack space the opsmx.io and opsmx.com are not so familiar with me. How do I sign up for the CDF slack workspace?
26/03/2021, 17:07:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): So glad that you're interested in GSoC @Bliss911!  That's great.  I believe CDF is still working to resolve the issue that is causing CDF slack registration requests to require an email address at opsmx.  Thankfully, GSoC conversations happen here and in the topic specific channels like https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/cloud-native-sig and https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/git-plugin and https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-cli-tool 
26/03/2021, 17:08:39 - @gayan17-5e8e8dbdd73408ce4fdfcb3f:gitter.im: Thank you very much for your feedbacks, will start working on it. I was stuck at a place due to COVID restrictions in my country. Now I can get back to working.
26/03/2021, 17:09:52 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): We meet each week in GSoC office hours for question and answer sessions to assist students as they are preparing their project proposals.

27/03/2021, 22:50:36 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): I want to schedule the online meetup to Friday noon UTC so that we have more time to prepare. Fine with you @MarkEWaite ? Or too early? We can also do it on Thursday or Wednesday, same time
27/03/2021, 23:00:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Friday noon UTC will be great.  Not too early.  Thanks for doing it.
27/03/2021, 23:02:19 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): One problem - it is a public holiday in many countries. Or is it even better?
27/03/2021, 23:04:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think that meetup is well suited to invite students from India.  I doubt Friday is a public holiday in India or most of southern Asia.  No objections to other days either.  Any one of those three work for me

27/03/2021, 23:08:44 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): Doing a meetup on April 1st would require us to come up with a few jokes

28/03/2021, 13:39:33 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: I long for this meetup. It would really help Newbies like me
28/03/2021, 13:42:56 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: I am having trouble picking an issue. This is what I am thinking I should do.
1. First, I want to work on contributing to the git-plugin so I need to clone the git-plugin repository to my local.
2. Secondly, I observed there are Newbie friendly issues. Would it be ok to start from here? Probably after cloning the git-plugin repo?
Please correct me where I am not getting right.
28/03/2021, 20:38:40 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): @Bliss911 yes, newcomer-friendly issues is a great way to get started
29/03/2021, 11:11:29 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: Hello everyone, I have finally prepared a draft for my proposal for GSoC, [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zzjMhrtE4bWK07AOaGHn0T7RxEi7QP8RbfsjVArTXhY/edit?usp=sharing). Suggestions, Style change or anything aimed towards improvement is welcome. I will also post it in the mailing list. Looking forward to the feedbacks.
29/03/2021, 15:09:59 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you'd like some specific experience with the git plugin and its companion the git client plugin, refer to https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60940 for an issue that has plenty of room for additional contributors.  Gives you a chance to experience development workflow by converting one or more test methods from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4.

will definitely join! I have project idea towards plugin installation tool, will try to focus on special features which need to use docker and git.

Morning Kara, I wonder how i can login without a proper email listed for this channel? Like opsmx.io etc.?
31/03/2021, 11:53:28 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): @werstatyw We have reported this issue to the CDF, waiting for the resolution. Currently I am logged into with the Ggmail account to this Slack workspace
31/03/2021, 12:35:38 - @werstatyw-5c9e6e4ad73408ce4fbc3f9c:gitter.im: Morning Oleg, it's not a big deal at the moment. I looked throught proposed projects and found 2 vacant and where i have expertise: Kubernetes and Logging inside Dockerized Jenkins with Graphana/Kibana. Could you or anybody else tell me which one is higher priority for the general Jenkins development? 
31/03/2021, 13:05:20 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): "Kubernetes" is a too wide area to comment. Would be nice to understand what particular project you would be interested in in this domai.

For "Logging inside Dockerized Jenkins with Graphana/Kibana", it is definitely an interesting project idea. There are solution for Jenkins, but not out of the box ones
31/03/2021, 13:59:36 - @werstatyw-5c9e6e4ad73408ce4fbc3f9c:gitter.im: Under "Kubernetes" umbrella i mean that one: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2021/project-ideas/jenkins-operator-security/

I'm in Budapest which should go to 2pm but there was some google calendar skew. Anyway, the only person to blame is me.

02/04/2021, 18:14:20 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: Hi! @oleg-nenashev , I would love to work on the 'Automatic Specification Generator for Jenkins REST API'. I have a strong grasp of REST API design and Swagger. I would only need to study the Open API while also rebuilding my Java Development skills. 
First, how can I know if some other student has not taken it up to work on it?
02/04/2021, 20:08:56 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): Hi @Bliss911 . There is no way to know for sure, though you can check existing public threads in the chat and mailing lists. In GSoC it is often that there are multiple competing applications 
03/04/2021, 08:54:04 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: I have already began studying the 'Security Validator for Jenkins Kubernetes Operator'. I really hope and pray no one is already working on this project. I'd be happy to know.

I'm working on it, already in a contact with a group of developers from VirtusLab.
03/04/2021, 10:00:05 - @werstatyw-5c9e6e4ad73408ce4fbc3f9c:gitter.im: and I could say that this is a bad strategy: take anything but vacant. You should ask yourself about what developing goals you would like to achieve, what career opportunities are you going to open after GSoC. And the most important, the one which lack almost all the GSoC projects with Jenkins: will you be able to maintain and further develop your solution?
03/04/2021, 11:12:35 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: Message deleted
03/04/2021, 11:14:02 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: Yea. You are very correct. I totally understand what you are saying. I joined this channel in 2020. I always wanted to make my contributions but it turned out I needed to learn and advance my knowledge. I loved DevOps and I chose it for my professional career. I chose to contribute to Jenkins ignorantly because it is my favourite tool in CI/CD. This is my final year as a student. But I still want to have this experience of contributing under Google Summer of Code. The ideas listed are fairly challenging but I have worked with and learned almost enough skillset required for me to send a pull request. Sorry about the long note. If you can, I would love some help in picking just 1 project idea.
03/04/2021, 11:14:45 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): @/all Yesterday's online meetup video is now available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5h0Vt8vjAI (high resolution is still being processed)

03/04/2021, 12:52:38 - @sharmapulkit04-5f86dcb5d73408ce4ff18086:gitter.im: @Bliss911, as @werstatyw mentioned, you should choose a project based on your interests. GSoC is a competitive program, and it is possible that you may not find an empty slot. And as you mentioned, you are interested in Jenkins, I have also been working on the project for quite a time, and what I have found that to solve the problem statement, you require very little knowledge of Jenkins itself but will require knowledge on Kubernetes, go and operators in general. So if you are really interested in developing those skills and it aligns best with your interests, you should go for it, and if not, you should reconsider. 
03/04/2021, 12:58:35 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: Thanks, @sharmapulkit04.
03/04/2021, 13:37:56 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): +1 to the provided feedback
03/04/2021, 13:41:32 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): In the recent years we had students with very good applications applying to the same project. If the applications are submitted early, org admins and mentors can work with students to find a way for their proposals to become independent so that they could be done in parallel and be successful independently. It is one of the reasons to send proposals early. FTR we cannot guarantee that both/any of the projects will be accepted, it is a subject for overall ranking and mentor availability
03/04/2021, 16:40:41 - @werstatyw-5c9e6e4ad73408ce4fbc3f9c:gitter.im: on the other hand, the other project which helps you sharpen your devops skills is Jenkins Remoting Monitoring. I thoroughly think over 2 of them and move towards Kubernetes.
04/04/2021, 13:25:05 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: thanks @oleg and @wertatyw.

07/04/2021, 18:24:00 - @bliss911-5e71afa9d73408ce4fdd2504:gitter.im: Do you advice further studies into this existing plugin while drafting a proposal?

08/04/2021, 08:14:47 - @werstatyw-5c9e6e4ad73408ce4fbc3f9c:gitter.im: I believe that the biggest pain and challenge for the passed gsoc project is actually to test, maintain and support with further development after final presentation ends. As part of my proposal I will try to solve this problem by further inspiring 2021 student group to continue commitments to their projects, schedule seldom meetings for discussions on our ideas and so on. So this might give great benefit to community. One of the goals is to continue project development for the next gsoc (2022) with aligned deliverables and fresh energy. The history for plugin manager as example will continue!

11/04/2021, 16:08:24 - @hp77-creator-58d72f75d73408ce4f53b53e:gitter.im: Hello everyone, Its less than a couple of days before the final day of proposal submission and I was wondering If I could get a chance to have a meeting with the mentors of the plugin installation manager tool improvements to discuss some of the issues that I have mentioned in my draft and also to get the final feedback in that way. I am open to anytime which is convenient to the mentors. Thank you!
11/04/2021, 16:31:59 - Dheeraj: Hello mentors, please have a look at my proposal as well, your feedback can help me to further improve it! Thanks!
12/04/2021, 00:12:00 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): Did you have a chance to send it to the platform SIG channels? I am not sure whether @sladyn98 or @kwhetstone have seen this proposal
12/04/2021, 00:13:21 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): Also note that the doc can be edited by anyone. This is not something I would recommend. Allowing only reviews is better
12/04/2021, 00:21:05 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): I am definitely not available tomorrow, sorry. I Can meet on Tuesdays's morning between 7am and 9am UTC. CC @sladyn98
12/04/2021, 00:38:31 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): Dear students, just a reminder that the student application deadline is April 13th, 18:00 UTC. By this time all student proposals should be submitted as final versions through the GSoC website to be considered during the project selection phase. Make sure to submit your proposals in time, and please do not postpone it till the very last minute.

If you have already submitted your proposal draft(s), thanks a lot! We will keep processing them providing feedback. If you did not get feedback for your proposals, please do not hesitate to ping potential mentors and, if needed, the GSoC org admin team.

If you have not submitted proposal drafts yet, please do so! It is still possible to get feedback from mentors and to improve your proposals based on that.

17/05/2021, 20:20:22 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): @/all Dear all, the GSoC 2021 projects have been announced by Google: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5542063241691136/#projects. On behalf of the CDF GSoC org team, we would like to thank all students who have applied to our organization this year! We appreciate all your effort, regardless of the acceptance decision. We also thank all potential mentors who worked on project ideas, worked with students during the application phase, and joined us during the proposal reviews.

This year we received dozens of great applications, but unfortunately we were unable to accept all of them. Our decisions are based on absolute and relative ranking of your proposal, number of project slots we received from Google and ability to form mentoring teams. This decision  If your application has not been accepted, please wait for the individual feedback. We will send it within 24 hours. We invite everybody to keep participating in the CDF project and to consider Google Summer of Code next year. We also organize other outreach programs in the CDF and Jenkins, and you are welcome to participate!

On behalf of the CDF GSoC Team, congrats to all accepted projects:

* Shruti Chaturvedi, CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins: Consume and Emit CloudEvents
* Harshit Chopra, Git credentials binding for sh, bat, and powershell
* Akihrio Kiuchi, Jenkins Remoting Monitoring
* Pulkit Sharma, Security Validator for Jenkins Kubernetes Operator
* Aditya Srivastava, Semantic Versioning Plugin for Jenkins
* Daniel Ko, try.spinnaker.io

Regarding plans for the next week:
* You should receive communications from your mentors about scheduling the first project meeting, communication channels and the next steps. If you do not receive such message by May 21, please contact GSoC org admins
* The next Jenkins GSoC office hours meeting on Wednesday WILL happen (May 19, 2PM UTC). We will discuss the community bonding phase and logistics for the GSoC projects. We will not be talking about project selection decisions there beyond basic Q&A.
* In the next few days we will publish initial project pages https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/. Here is your first task: please create your contributor profile pages as documented here: https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/. We will use these profiles in the next steps.

If you have any questions about next steps, please ask in the Jenkins GSoC Gitter chat, in the #GSoC channel in the CDF Slack workspace, or in the mailing list. For acceptance decision feedback, please contact org admins or wait for the feedback emails.

Have a great summer,
CDF GSoC org team

17/06/2021, 19:37:08 - @pikachu404-5ea4b443d73408ce4fe1b2a3:gitter.im: Hello everyone, 
I hope everyones project is going great! üôÉ

23/06/2021, 16:14:53 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): So sorry, I should have started the meeting 15 minutes ago.  Since we've not seen any requests in this channel and had no one attending last week, I think we can skip the meeting this week.
23/06/2021, 16:15:23 - kuro: I was waiting for the host to start the meeting but then thought might be cancelled due to cdcon and contributor summit 
23/06/2021, 16:15:49 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): So sorry @adi10hero:matrix.org .  I'm happy to start the meeting now if there are topics you'd like to discuss

23/06/2021, 16:18:44 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The awkward part is that if I really meant to cancel the meeting, I should have removed it from the calendar.  I didn't do that.  Poor communication on my part
23/06/2021, 16:19:00 - kuro: If there are not other requests then can I use this meeting to know how to run plugin (the one I am working on) locally

24/07/2021, 12:57:00 - kuro: Hello MarkEWaite (Mark Waite), I am not sure if this is the correct SIG for asking this but is there a way to run jenkins.io website locally without docker?  So I am asking for an alternative to `make run` or `make generate`...  Docker isn't working for me in both my windows and Linux machines.
24/07/2021, 14:24:35 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @halkeye had done some work attempting to make jenkins.io development possible without docker, but I believe he suspended effort on that pull request.  May be better for us to spend some time investigating how to make Docker work on your Linux machine.
24/07/2021, 14:52:26 - kuro: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "@halkeye had done some work atte..."> Oh okay, well my linux machine is Ubuntu 16.04 and docker doesn't support it anymore, I tried installing older docker version ( I am just lazy to update the OS but meh,  I should) so the older version got installed but the docker daemon won't start. I didn't really spend a lot of time debugging it as I thought, if there's an alternate way, let me try that first. But, I will try to debug and get back to you for help if required, is that okay?
24/07/2021, 14:53:49 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I'd spend the time to upgrade that Ubuntu 16.04 to 20.04.  There are additional developments coming to Jenkins infra (docker image improvements) that are best on most recent Ubuntu LTS (20.04)
24/07/2021, 15:25:22 - kuro: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "I'd spend the time to upgrade th..."> üëçÔ∏è okay, I will do that

What are the needed steps to join GSOC and work on it?
25/10/2021, 18:54:11 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): That project was completed in 2020.  The project summary presentations are available from https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/github-checks/.  Source code is available at https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-checks-plugin .  Installation statistics for the plugin are available from https://stats.jenkins.io/pluginversions/github-checks.html .  The plugin is actively used on ci.jenkins.io and other large volume Jenkins installations
25/10/2021, 18:55:27 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Jenkins will participate in Google Summer of Code 2022.  You may want to review other project ideas to see if they are interesting or consider proposing your own project.

15/12/2021, 02:38:16 - Kris Stern: Hi everyone! My name is Kris and I am a new contributor to Jenkins, currently working on some PRs aiming to improve the conventional-commits-plugin repo. I would like to volunteer for GSoC, either as an organization admin or as a mentor. I have previously involved with GSoC twice as a student, once in 2019 and the other in 2020 under the OpenAstronomy organization, having successfully completed two projects then. Is there any good project ideas for me to develop on? And am I eligible to volunteer?

15/12/2021, 10:54:52 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Welcome @stu01509 and @krisstern:matrix.org .  Delighted to have you both interested in the Jenkins project and Google Summer of Code.  You can read more about Jenkins in Google Summer of Code at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ .  The project ideas from 2021 that were not implemented in GSoC 2021 are good candidates to start.  See https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2021/project-ideas/ for the list of all ideas.  Project ideas from 2020 are also good sources of ideas at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/project-ideas/ .
15/12/2021, 16:46:45 - @stu01509-5e3be7e5d73408ce4fd8db29:gitter.im: Thanks for your advice, I will try to find some repo and send the PR.

Just heard about the Google Summer of Code. Is it limited only to college students, or could anyone else getting started in the open source community be accepted?
08/01/2022, 10:47:52 - Dheeraj: Hello @SelfDependentHuman,
Good timing! This year GSoC will be open to all newcomers of open source that are 18 years and older. So now it is not just limited to college students.

21/01/2022, 14:20:33 - Kris Stern: Just would like to add that most Jenkins projects available this year (2022) are Java-based, so it may be a good chance to pick up a new language or to gain more experience in using it on a meaningful project, especially for those who started in some interpreted languages like Python.

31/01/2022, 10:40:46 - Jmm: Good question kdaud (Kakumirizi Daud) 
Let's wait for MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) (the potential mentor) to come online (he is located in the US). He is the best person to give you hints on that subject.
31/01/2022, 10:44:57 - kdaud (Kakumirizi Daud): Thanks @jmmeessen:matrix.org for the directives. In the meantime as we wait for him,  do we a documentation on how to set up the dev environment for technical contributors? perhaps the tools one need to install on the machine to start off with development?
31/01/2022, 10:56:11 - Jmm: üòÄ
You will need at least a functional Maven and Git/Github access. An IDE definitely helps. IntelliJ is quite popular. But use the Java IDE you are used to.
Initial step would be to compile a plugin (in this case the Git plugin) and get familiar with it. Another good entry point is https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial/.
I just saw that on the proposal page (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/automatic-git-cache-maintenance/) , Mark gave links to Newbie Friendly issues. Worth starting to look at while waiting for Mark to come on-line.

I am currently studying about `Pipeline Step Documentation Generator improvements` and also find the `Plugin Health Scoring system` idea interesting. Thank you.

An other good source to get started is to watch the series of Livestream recording where Darin Pope and Mark Waite show how to modernise Jenkins plugins. It shows how to find a plugin and do some small improvements to it. I will look around and see if we can provide a structured way to get into the matter, based on your very good questions.
31/01/2022, 11:39:10 - kdaud (Kakumirizi Daud): In the meantime , is it possible to provide a link to this live stream recording so as to get a glimpse on the project?

I have a pretty sound knowledge of Java, Go and Kubernetes. Although the idea of "Plugin health score" is not yet confirmed, I'd like to know the tech stack used and how can I contribute to it.
Thanks :)
08/02/2022, 08:30:49 - Jmm: Hello hamees-sayed (Hamees Sayed) 
Thank you for your interest. You're very welcome to join and contribute to our Ecosystem. The plugin health score is taking more and more substance and will make it in the final list.

Don't hesitate to join us during the GSoC "Office Hour" where we will discuss and clarify projects. This week we will have the EMEA (Europe/Middle-East/Africa) edition (14:00/2PM UTC). Next week will be the Pacific edition (03:00/3AM UTC). We will be alternating meetings to try to cover the globe conveniently.

13/02/2022, 16:15:02 - khamarshaikh (Khamar Shaikh): I came across this idea : automatic-git-cache-maintenance and interested to contribute around it
13/02/2022, 16:15:10 - khamarshaikh (Khamar Shaikh): can someone please help me to get started along it
13/02/2022, 20:36:47 - Jmm: Hello khamarshaikh (Khamar Shaikh) 
I remember that this project has been discussed during the last GSoC Office Hour. I encourage you to listen to the recording. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit?usp=sharing 
But you probably have other, more practical, questions. You can join the next Open Office session to ask these questions. (strongly recommended). We alternate the time so that everyone can join, whichever timezone he is.
Maybe a project mentor, as MarkEWaite (Mark Waite)  may also give you specific tips to get started and help you write a good candidature.
13/02/2022, 21:25:05 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Read the documentation for `git maintenance` from https://git-scm.com/docs/git-maintenance for ideas of the types of problems that can exist for git repositories and that benefit from maintenance tasks.  Consider alternatives available to perform similar maintenance tasks on a Jenkins controller or on Jenkins agents.  Explore the scheduling alternatives available with Jenkins.  Install a Jenkins controller, create a multibranch Pipeline with a GitHub branch source provider and look at the caches created on the Jenkins controller.  Consider how the Jenkins controller created those caches and how a maintenance job would find those caches and schedule the maintenance work on those caches.  Compare the maintenance task results with command line git and JGit.  Are all the maintenance operations feasible in JGit.

15/02/2022, 16:49:29 - Aviii06 (Archit): @MarkEWaite does there exist some older jenkins infrastructure regarding the automatic maintenance? or are we going to build it from scratch.
15/02/2022, 17:03:27 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Aviii06 I assume the automatic maintenance would reuse the Jenkins concepts of scheduling work (cron style) to report on the need for maintenance and to schedule maintenance tasks.  We'd need a UI to control the scheduling and would likely need some throttling mechanism so that the maintenance does not create an undue burden on the controller at any one time.

15/02/2022, 18:09:04 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Sure @SahityaGupta25 .  Refer to the https://www.jenkins.io/participate/ for general areas where you can contribute.  If one of them is more interesting to you, choose that one.  The GSoC project ideas at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/ offer good opportunities to contribute and consider.  Google Summer of Code office hours meet once a week as described at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/#office-hours
15/02/2022, 18:11:03 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @SahityaGupta25 if you'd like a more specific project, you could contribute by updating one or more of the git client plugin tests from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4.  See https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60940 for a description of the techniques being used.

16/02/2022, 07:35:09 - DevUt (Utkarsh Tiwari): Hey guys! üòÅ  do we have mentor for the plugin health project yet ?
16/02/2022, 08:07:20 - halkeye: DevUt (Utkarsh Tiwari): in an async environment, its usually good practice to not ask yes/no questions, but instead ask questions with details/context.

"Do we have a mentor for the plugin health project yet?"
12 hours later
"no"
12 hours later
"okay i'm interested"

vs
"I'm interested in helping out as a mentor for the plugin health project, is there a mentor yet?"

you saved a bunch of back and forth  (just an example, i have no idea why your asking)
16/02/2022, 11:34:48 - DevUt (Utkarsh Tiwari): Oops I should have cleared my intent, I was just asking because if we have a mentor for that that means the project is an accepted idea right, so that was the sole reason. Apologies!
16/02/2022, 11:54:55 - Jmm: Hello DevUt (Utkarsh Tiwari) 
Yes there are three mentors registered for that project (with one located in France).
I am working on the promotion of the project to "draft" status
16/02/2022, 11:55:57 - Jmm: I am still working on the PR. It will also give more details about the project itself
16/02/2022, 11:56:10 - Jmm: I will post here when it is merged

17/02/2022, 00:41:21 - alyssat (Alyssat): Hi @aaryan-gautam:matrix.org  Thank you for your interest. We'll get that link fixed but you are actually on the correct chat channel here. Feel free to chat away.
17/02/2022, 04:48:02 - Aaryan Gautam: I wanted to know the expected length and size of the project whether its 175 hours (medium) or 350 hours (large) so that I can plan out the functionality that my project can include and understand the full scope of the project. I also wanted to inquire about the idea page as it mentions to "implement similar capabilities to manage the cached copies of git repositories" so I wanted to know what it meant by the similar capabilities that could be added and is there a resource/resources that can be suggested to me for learning about the cached copies and if there are some starter bugs specific to this project that can help me get familiar and get a better understanding for my proposal for this project
17/02/2022, 07:54:01 - Dheeraj: > Read the documentation for `git maintenance` from https://git-scm.com/docs/git-maintenance for ideas of the types of problems that can exist for git repositories and that benefit from maintenance tasks.

@aaryan-gautam:matrix.org  Not sure if you've read this quoted message before or not but it might help you by answering some of your questions. 
17/02/2022, 14:48:29 - Kris Stern: Hi Aaryan Gautam Welcome to the community! Regarding the "Automatic git cache maintenance on the controller" project, there are new newbie issues with links at [here](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/automatic-git-cache-maintenance/#newbie-friendly-issues). While the standard duration of GSoC is 175 hours, it can be hard to gauge whether more time will be needed as every project will be mentored on a case-by-case basis, as the duration has much to do with the GSoC contributor per se. The project length also depends on the scope and number of features you intend to add to the Jenkins controller. The most important thing to note at the beginning is what "git maintenance" is capable of, so that we could also implement this to Jenkins.

On the official `git` site it says:
> The git maintenance command is designed to simplify the repository maintenance patterns while minimizing user wait time during Git commands. A variety of configuration options are available to allow customizing this process. The default maintenance options focus on operations that complete quickly, even on large repositories.

So this could be a point to keep in mind while developing your own proposal for the project idea. 
17/02/2022, 16:37:36 - Jmm: FYI: the GSoC project idea "Plugin Health Score" has been promoted to "draft" and its documentation updated. https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/plugin-health-scoring-system/
17/02/2022, 17:50:06 - DevUt (Utkarsh Tiwari): Yay!

20/02/2022, 10:55:49 - Aaryan Gautam: I was looking through the issues and I wanted to ask whether this issue is also something that would be addressed with the git cache maintenance on the controller. 
https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-19022
20/02/2022, 12:51:50 - Wimukti (Wimukthi Indeewara): Thank you so much for the information. I'll proceed with some newbie-friendly issues.
20/02/2022, 14:12:03 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hey! How do I get started with `git-plugin`.  I cloned the repo and ran `mvn clean install`. How do I use the plugin? Do I need to install jenkins to use the plugin or can I just run the cloned project locally?
20/02/2022, 14:14:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The tests are intended to be resilient to multiple environments.  If they are failing in your environment, that means there is a previously undiscovered problem in the tests.  It would be a good contribution to identify the problem in the tests and fix it.  That exercise will also help you understand more about the plugin source code and how to debug tests .  Other will benefit from your work as the tests become more correct for multiple environments.

Some steps to take:

* Assure you are using Maven 3.8.4 from the command line and not an older version (`mvn --version`)
* Assure you are using either Java 8 or Java 11.  Other Java versions are not supported for development of most plugins (`mvn --version`)
* Run the tests from the command line (`mvn clean verify`)
* If a test fails in the context of the full run, check it as a single class (`mvn clean -Dtest=TestClassName verify`)
* If a test fails when run in a single class, check it as a single method (`mvn clean -Dtest=TestClassName#testMethodName verify`)
* Check that the test is passing on the ci.jenkins.io job(s) for the plugin.  If the test is unreliable ("flaky"), that's a good cause for investigation
* Run test from inside the IDE
* Confirm the IDE is using Maven 3.8.4
* Confirm the IDE is using Java 8 or is using Java 11
* Debug the failure to understand why it is failing in that context when it is passing on multiple CI servers
20/02/2022, 14:15:21 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): You can run it locally with the command `mvn hpi:run`.  That will start a Jenkins controller with the git plugin loaded.

20/02/2022, 17:35:19 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): [![Screenshot from 2022-02-20 22-04-01.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/CvhF/thumb/Screenshot-from-2022-02-20-22-04-01.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/CvhF/Screenshot-from-2022-02-20-22-04-01.png)
20/02/2022, 17:35:52 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hey Mark! Facing an issue while adding git repo to jenkins. I created a repo on github and added it to an existing jenkin build.  
20/02/2022, 17:39:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Interesting failure mode.  There will be a stack trace in the console log of the Jenkins process that matches the identifier displayed on that page.  If you're using gitpod, it could be an artifact from that environment.  If you're running locally, then check the stack trace
20/02/2022, 17:46:28 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): The stack tree is very huge. There are a lot of errors being displayed in the console.

`
Could not initialize class com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.CredentialsProvider
Could not initialize class com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.ViewCredentialsAction$RootActionImpl
Could not initialize class com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.UserCredentialsProvider
Could not initialize class com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.ViewCredentialsAction
`
20/02/2022, 17:48:12 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Is there an "out of memory" error reported somewhere before that?  Could not initialize the credentials class is probably a blocking failure
20/02/2022, 17:49:47 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): JENKINS-19022 is not related to git cache maintenance and is not a good choice for a new contributor.  Three different attempts have been made to resolve that issue while still retaining compatibility with all the consumers of the git plugin data.  All three attempts failed
20/02/2022, 17:50:40 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Choose another issue as your introduction.  Converting unit tests from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4 still has many tests to be converted.  Other issues are also available
20/02/2022, 17:50:44 - Dheeraj: @Hrushi20 If you like, you can copy the full console output in any online Pastebin and share the link here. Example: https://pastebin.com/
20/02/2022, 18:05:50 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I don't find "out of memory" error anywhere in the terminal. 
20/02/2022, 18:06:46 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hey Dheeraj, Pastebin doesn't support error logs more than 512kb for free tier. The terminal logs errors is very huge and I am not able to add it to paste bin.
20/02/2022, 18:09:10 - Dheeraj: Oh makes sense. I generally paste the bottom part of the logs because that's where the main clues regarding the source of error(s) are.
20/02/2022, 18:09:50 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I reduced the terminal logs are created the paste bin url of size 502kb. https://pastebin.com/K4cbt26Q. I am not sure if this log contains the error.
20/02/2022, 18:13:01 - Dheeraj: Where does the error start from? can you also try posting that?
20/02/2022, 18:16:47 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): [![Screenshot from 2022-02-20 22-44-59.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/IeJJ/thumb/Screenshot-from-2022-02-20-22-44-59.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/IeJJ/Screenshot-from-2022-02-20-22-44-59.png)
20/02/2022, 18:19:02 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hey mark! It looks like an "out of memory error". My  ram was running at 90%.  After terminating the process, my system returned to normal condition.
20/02/2022, 18:20:04 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I am not sure where exactly the error starts from. The logs are being displayed when I open the project. 
20/02/2022, 18:27:10 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Dheeraj, do I need to initialize anything related to github before starting the project? 
20/02/2022, 18:35:32 - Dheeraj: Not sure, do you have git installed in your machine?
20/02/2022, 18:46:19 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Yes mate. I have git installed on my computer.
20/02/2022, 18:47:31 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I am not facing that issue now. I restarted the entire jenkins process and ran the git-plugin again. The git repository is working as expected. Not sure why it didn't work in the first attempt.
Thank You

21/02/2022, 01:21:30 - Aaryan Gautam: when I run mvn clean verify on the cloned version, it takes a long time to run the testcases and slows my computer down. What could be the issue? It starts to take 100% cpu and 90% memory and disk
21/02/2022, 03:28:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): That is expected. The tests perform file operations and should apply load to the computer.
21/02/2022, 15:47:48 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hey! I want to start by fixing this issue https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-54868. I commented my way of approach to this issue. Not sure if that is the best way to proceed. Need some insights regarding implementation of the issue.
Thank You
22/02/2022, 00:10:25 - Kris Stern: HI Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh) You could follow up on the issue with a PR and initiate discussion from there, otherwise it would be hard to tell exactly what you mean to do to fix the issue. 
22/02/2022, 00:11:56 - Kris Stern: You can use the closed PR as a reference.
22/02/2022, 02:04:47 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thank You @krisstern:matrix.org . I'll send my PR to initiate a discussion.

25/02/2022, 03:27:47 - Dheeraj: I hope the same!
25/02/2022, 10:08:58 - Aaryan Gautam: I am getting the following warning when I try to run mvn clean verify. However, when I try to redirect the -Dfile to Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_311\lib\tools.jar, it tells me that the specified file does not exist at the [relative path to]/git/plugin/C:Program. What should I put for -Dfile?

25/02/2022, 10:20:31 - Aaryan Gautam: I get 19 errors from which 17 are caused by test timed out exceptions. One of them is from the job not been triggered. Can anyone suggest me when I can start by looking into these errors? When I run the same clone on gitpod, it works fine passing all the testcases.

25/02/2022, 13:33:33 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hey, I have submitted a pull request regarding issue [JENKINS-54868](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-54868). This is a basic version which can be modified to get the desired feature. Open for any kind of suggestions. 
Pull Request: https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin/pull/1226
25/02/2022, 15:46:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I updated that pull request so that it would pass the build process.  It is now merged into the list of project ideas
26/02/2022, 04:18:48 - Kris Stern: That's great MarkEWaite (Mark Waite)!
26/02/2022, 04:25:01 - Kris Stern: <@hrushi20-62090e486da037398490448d:gitter.im "Hey, I have submitted a pull req..."> It may be good to add the tests as you go too to make sure the code you wrote is valid for the use cases concerned 
26/02/2022, 04:29:18 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Sure. I was not sure about the code implementation. Hence I didn't add the test cases. I will add the tests and update the PR.

The branch name `dev` could be misconstrued as something else unintended. 
26/02/2022, 15:00:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Message deleted
26/02/2022, 15:03:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Some of the things that can cause test failures in one environment but not show failures in another include:
* Memory pressure - too little memory to run the tests
* Tests that inadvertently depend on execution order
* Tests that timeout due to insufficient processor speed or file system speed
* Tests that have inadvertent performance or timing dependencies
26/02/2022, 15:04:58 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): In the stack trace that you've shared, it shows a test timeout after 180 seconds.  I've not seen those failures in my test environments or on ci.jenkins.io, but that doesn't mean there aren't unexpected performance or timing dependencies, just that I've not seen them
26/02/2022, 15:35:53 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @KrisStern. Thank You. I'll add the tests.I'll close that pull request and create a new draft pull request with a different branch name. 
27/02/2022, 02:37:01 - Kris Stern: Next time once you have a PR don't rush to close it and restart a new one right away. It was more a suggestion for when there will be a next time. 
27/02/2022, 04:35:01 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I am extremely sorry. I'll ensure to be careful next time. 
27/02/2022, 04:40:34 - Kris Stern: <@hrushi20-62090e486da037398490448d:gitter.im "I am extremely sorry. I'll ensur..."> No worries... Actually the repo is monitored by many people including the maintainers themselves
27/02/2022, 04:41:14 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @krisstern I am facing some difficulties in testing the code I wrote. 
27/02/2022, 04:41:58 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Can I create a PR and can you help me test that code?
27/02/2022, 04:42:59 - Kris Stern: I don't think that is a good idea, but what is the stack trace for the errors thrown? 
27/02/2022, 04:44:55 - Kris Stern: <@hrushi20-62090e486da037398490448d:gitter.im "Can I create a PR and can you he..."> Or could you provide more details about the difficulties you are encountering? 
27/02/2022, 04:49:08 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Basically I created a global Configuration to get Global Regex from the administrator. Using this global Regex, I am iterating all the git urls and getting the org name and repo name.  While testing I am not able to set the Global regex and test the git url to get the org name and repo name.
27/02/2022, 04:51:02 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also different urls have different requirements. How do I implement that feature with a single global Regex. Do I keep updating the global Regex every time for different kinds of urls?
27/02/2022, 05:16:53 - Kris Stern: <@hrushi20-62090e486da037398490448d:gitter.im "Also different urls have differe..."> I think Ian Williams have already answered your question [here](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-54868?focusedCommentId=422365&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-422365)
27/02/2022, 05:41:56 - Kris Stern: <@hrushi20-62090e486da037398490448d:gitter.im "Also different urls have differe..."> If my understanding of regex is accurate, I think you can use one global URL pattern to encompass all the example URL patterns provided by Mark Waite previously as examples in the JIRA you quoted, so this goal in principal at least should be manageable, but the regex pattern will be fairly complicated. So you will need to experiment a bit. 
27/02/2022, 05:49:10 - Kris Stern: So some parts in the URL pattern can be made optional to satisfy the requirements
27/02/2022, 06:06:20 - halkeye: Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): i'm slowly catching up. With regards to testing. I think the problem is your trying to test the entire problem. One of the good things about testing is to highlight when that happens. You'll find it easier to test if you pull it out into a new class/set of functions, so you don't need to create a full jenkins instance
27/02/2022, 10:00:54 - Kris Stern: Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh):  I do somehow feel the regex used previously in [PR #1226](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin/pull/1226) may not be adequate to catch all the possible patterns.

Also, I second halkeye in that you should break out your tests into a new class/set of functions to manage the different main pattern categories.
27/02/2022, 10:28:37 - halkeye: Is the intention to find URLs in a string? Or to validate URLs? For the first the stack overflow solutions have kinda been crowd sourced so pretty solid - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/161738/what-is-the-best-regular-expression-to-check-if-a-string-is-a-valid-url

For validating, you should use the url class. It'll be more reliable than anything you come up with
27/02/2022, 10:33:38 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): The intention is to get the Organization name and the repository name from the url. Different kinds of hosting platforms like github, gitlab, bitbucket,azure etc have different kinds of url format. We need to extract the exact organization name and repository name from all kinds of git urls and also private domain git urls. 
27/02/2022, 11:03:38 - halkeye: Yea id use the url object to parse it into its various parts personally.
28/02/2022, 01:26:38 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @halkeye:g4v.dev Thanks mate. I looked into the url object and I'll try proceeding in that direction. 
28/02/2022, 01:27:30 - halkeye: fyi, just because someone suggests something, doesn't mean thats the answer, its worth looking at, but it could easily not fit your needs
28/02/2022, 01:33:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I'm not sure that a Java URL object will accept all the forms that are valid git URL's.  If it does, then that would make it much easier to extract the hostname and other interesting components.
28/02/2022, 03:52:50 - Kris Stern: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "I'm not sure that a Java URL obj..."> I think it could be constructed, but would be fairly complex regex indeed. So maybe a list of potential patterns would be more manageable both to write and use the code for both the user and the developer. 
28/02/2022, 15:05:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I wonder if the global configuration might be better done as a series of regular expressions and replacement text strings so that the user could specify one row for each type of repository they may use.  For example:

* `.*github.com.*` -> "GitHub"
* `.*bitbucket.org.*` -> "Bitbucket"
* `.*gitlab.com.*` -> "GitLab"

If the user were allowed to add new pairs of regular expressions and replacement strings it would allow full flexibility for any URL format that they may be using
28/02/2022, 16:03:04 - Kris Stern: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "I wonder if the global configura..."> Yeah, that would be a lot more palatable as an approach, clean and neat
28/02/2022, 16:49:09 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I looked into the java url object and learnt that the java url object doesn't support all kinds of url. 
Eg: git@bitbucket.org:markewaite/tasks.git  is not supported by the java url object. 
28/02/2022, 16:50:53 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @MarkEWaite, I love the idea of series of regular expressions and replacement text strings. It would be clean and easy for the user to implement.

01/03/2022, 01:12:17 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The default configuration is to fork a single process for up to 80% of the cores on the computer.  You can change that with the command:
```
$ mvn clean -DforkCount=1 verify
```
01/03/2022, 01:14:34 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): You're welcome to submit a pull request to remove the `forkCount` setting from the pom.xml file.  That will then require developers that want parallel execution to provide the command line arguments necessary for parallel execution.

01/03/2022, 08:38:34 - Kris Stern: Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I have a feeling you are not spending enough time on your own to do research and experimentation before asking for suggestions. Maybe try to dive deep a bit to get a feel for things more first? 
01/03/2022, 09:07:14 - Kris Stern: Also, remember to refer back to the [original JIRA issue](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-54868) where there is extensive discussion surrounding the topic 
01/03/2022, 09:09:12 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Sure. I am facing difficulties only in implementing the rules for different organizations other than github,gitlab and bitbucket. Covering all kinds of url is a tricky task.

There is a small issue with the implementation. 

Urls such as
``` 
"https://gitlab.com/MarkWaite/github.com"
"https://github.com/MarkWaite/gitlab.com" 
```
 will throw errors. Thinking of ways to solve this.

Also Thank You guys for your support. I know I have been very slow in understanding and implementing things.

01/03/2022, 15:50:30 - Kris Stern: > It might be best to have a list of regular expression patterns in the global configuration. Then the administrator could define patterns like

```git@bitbucket.org:(?<group>[^/?#]+)/(?<repo>[^/?#]+).git```

```https://([^@/]+@)?(?<group>[^./?#]+).visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_git/(?<repo>[^/?#]+)```

> Probably just a few patterns would suffice for each Jenkins instance. Put some sample patterns in the help text and let the administrator copy from there. This way, the feature would also work with on-premises servers that can have arbitrary hostnames.
01/03/2022, 17:30:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I was assuming a user interface that would allow the user to specify one regular expression per line with replacement text optionally extracted from the results of the regular expression evaluation.  For example, one line of configuration might have two fields, one for the regular expression and the other for the replacement text that will be displayed to the user.  It might be like this:

Regular expression: `.*github.com.([^/]+)/(.*)`
Replacement text: GitHub organization \1, repository \2
01/03/2022, 17:38:35 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): So are you saying that when a user enters the regexp: `.*github.com.([^/]+)/(.*)` along with replacement text: `GitHub organization \1, repository \2`, then for all the repositories containing github, it should display the orgName and repoName as stated in the replacement text?
01/03/2022, 17:48:42 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): That was the idea that I was considering, yes.  I don't know if it is the right idea, but it seemed that the user would better understand a series of rows where each row represents one of the git providers they use.  They insert their regular expression on the left and the replacement text on the right, then Jenkins uses the replacement text when it sees a match for that regular expression
01/03/2022, 17:50:48 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): What about the case where the replacement text is not entered? You stated it's optional right. Then do we need to extract it manually? 
01/03/2022, 17:56:45 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also Mark, can you look at the current implementation. 
01/03/2022, 17:58:44 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @krisstern:matrix.org I didn't update the help text as I am waiting for confirmation about the implementation.

It may be insufficient memory.  It may be that the number of threads allowed by the kernel is insufficient.  I commonly see my Jenkins controller machines running with 900 threads known to the Linux kernel.  Are you intentionally limiting the number of threads that the kernel can allocate?

They run on ci.jenkins.io very frequently.  They run on my test CI environments very frequently.  They run for others very frequently.  

Unfortunately, if the equipment available to you is not sufficient to run the tests, it seems like it will also not be sufficient to do development.  Can you request more capacity from the university VM?

I don't remember, did you already explore the GitPod path ? 
It is a good alternative for situations like yours. The free tier is 50 hours. It most likely insufficient for GSoC as is, but they have a special license for Open Source work. So all doors are not closed.

Other alternative to explore, is to skip the tests that consume a lot of ressources (and run them on GitPod) while you are working on enhancing the plugin. 

Worth digging IMHO 
03/03/2022, 11:22:34 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Oh I see, I thought it requires us to shift the repo in `jenkins-infra/jenkins.io` to refer to the tool locally. I couldn't  find the code written in the temporary patch section of the readme. Perhaps `jenkins.io` code was changed and the readme was not updated?
03/03/2022, 17:50:28 - halkeye: vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): it'll be really slow to write code, commit, wait for results, write more code. If you can't run the entire suite you should look into running a subset.

There's not a lot of point setting up GitHub actions. Create a draft pr and when you push CI.jenkins.io will run the tests for you
03/03/2022, 17:50:55 - halkeye: Er sorry I meant Aaryan Gautam

> Review the features available from "git maintenance" and identify ways that the Jenkins controller could use those features or implement similar capabilities to manage the cached copies of git repositories. Review issues in the Jenkins issue tracker that may indicate other areas where git plugin repository maintenance could help the Jenkins controller. 
07/03/2022, 12:53:43 - Kris Stern: The key is probably how to either **integrate** or **incorporate** `git maintenance` capabilities in or with the Jenkins controller. Perhaps MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) will be able to elaborate more on this later.

07/03/2022, 13:04:24 - Kris Stern: Maybe I am misunderstanding your question... Could you tell me more about what you are trying to achieve?
07/03/2022, 13:09:12 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): In the parent project pom the junit version is 4.13.2 . Don't i need to change the version to 5 in https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/tree/plugin-4.37 and create a tag of 4.38?
07/03/2022, 13:15:29 - Kris Stern: baruKreddy (baruKreddy): I see what you mean now. But we are having a slightly different setup as the `junit` Jenkins plugin is used instead: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/junit
07/03/2022, 13:17:08 - Kris Stern: More info about the `junit` Jenkins plugin can be found say from here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin
07/03/2022, 13:33:10 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): So now no need to change in parent pom. As we have https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin . you want me to just make changes in build-timeout-plugin for changing it to junit 5

07/03/2022, 14:46:38 - Kris Stern: baruKreddy (baruKreddy):  You can probably refer to this merged PR as an example https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-timeout-plugin/pull/73

07/03/2022, 15:03:45 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hello World! I thought I'll install the entire jenkins software on my computer and explore jenkins in depth. When I copy and paste the code from https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable, I get an error while running the second step. 
The error displayed is: `no matches found: [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc`.

I also tried changing `/dev/null` to a some  path on my computer, but the same error persists. 

07/03/2022, 18:26:58 - halkeye: Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): that's odd.  Do you know what she'll you are running? Looks like it's interpreting the echo differently

07/03/2022, 18:28:34 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): It seems  there's no support for junit 5 in Jenkins .Because even though junit 1.53 version is present in the pom of jenkins. Its still needs jupiter dependency to be added to import junit statements.

07/03/2022, 19:36:46 - Ulli Hafner: > <@barukreddy-622260b36da037398491813e:gitter.im> I'm trying to migrate from Junit 4 to Junit 5

Here is an example pom.xml that shows what to include for Junit 5: https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-pom-plugin/blob/63ace21e6d6ce07e17f949a37021662c188ac00d/pom.xml#L95. Note, that a migration is not so easy since integration tests still require Junit 4. I have a work in progress PR. That uses JUnit 5 for integration tests as well: https://github.com/jenkinsci/forensics-api-plugin/pull/400
07/03/2022, 19:39:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Another example that uses JUnit 5 is located at https://github.com/jenkinsci/platformlabeler-plugin/blob/master/pom.xml
08/03/2022, 02:14:49 - Dheeraj: **What is my aim?**
I'm trying to find the source from where the mvn fetches the updated parent version of a plugin when I run $ mvn versions:update-parent

**What have I tried so far?**
I read this article: https://themightyprogrammer.dev/snippet/maven-parent-update, and found out that the new version is taken from the local maven repository of the plugin.

**What am I stuck with?**
When I updated the parent version of the Parameterized trigger plugin (https://github.com/jenkinsci/parameterized-trigger-plugin/pull/235/files#diff-9c5fb3d1b7e3b0f54bc5c4182965c4fe1f9023d449017cece3005d3f90e8e4d8R7) I could see the new parent version as "4.33". Where did that come from? I looked for it in the local maven repo of this plugin here: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/parameterized-trigger but couldn't find 4.33. What am I missing?
08/03/2022, 04:14:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @dheerajodha as far as I understand it, Maven reads the id of the parent pom , asks each of the remotes for the list of all versions of the parent pom, then inserts the value that it determines to be the "highest" based on its definition of version number comparison
08/03/2022, 04:16:23 - Aaryan Gautam: <@krisstern:matrix.org "The key is probably how to eithe..."> MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): can you follow up on this?
08/03/2022, 04:33:27 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The Jenkins controller creates the git caches using git.  The caches are stored in a format that is well understood by command line git and by JGit.  It can use command line git to perform the tasks.

It cannot rely on the `git maintenance` commands because the `git maintenance` commands are only available in command line git versions 2.30 and later.  Jenkins continues to support CentOS 7, Debian 10, and Ubuntu 18.  All of them default to command line git versions that do not provide the `git maintenance` command.  Since we want to provide full functionality on those Linux versions with their default command line git, I think it would be best to implement the scheduling and the detailed operations in the Jenkins Java code.  It can use command line git, but cannot rely on the existence of the `git maintenance` command.

I don't know if it is better to do it as a part of the git plugin or as a separate plugin that depends on the git plugin.
08/03/2022, 04:37:20 - Dheeraj: I see...that seems a little tricky to calculate. I asked this to find out how the latest parent version is calculated so then, I'd be able to answer for a given plugin if it has the latest parent version or not (as part of the "Data Collection" phase of Plugin Health Score) using the function called:
"boolean isParentVersionLatest(String pluginId)" and accordingly calculate the plugin score.

08/03/2022, 04:42:01 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Why not just call `mvn versions:update-parent`, read the result from the file, then discard the result?
08/03/2022, 04:44:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think I've heard that dependabot resolves dependencies including the parent pom without requiring calls to maven.  If you don't mind reading Ruby, you could refer to https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/search?q=parent_pom
08/03/2022, 04:57:48 - Dheeraj: Oh nice! These are some really helpful suggestions, I'll read them now. Thanks a lot
08/03/2022, 05:09:44 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): These would be really helpful.I will go through these and make relevant changes

08/03/2022, 16:19:49 - Ulli Hafner: As mentioned above, you cannot use JUnit 5 in integration tests (i.e., tests with a running Jenkins instance via a `JenkinsRule`) right now. In https://github.com/jenkinsci/forensics-api-plugin/pull/400 you will find a working example on how to do that. But this approach requires the new dependency `plugin-util` in your tests.

08/03/2022, 17:07:47 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thanks @krisstern:matrix.org. I'll look into it :)
08/03/2022, 18:06:05 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): So basically @MarkEWaite, is there a custom git cache format created in java which is then stored in the `.git` directory?
08/03/2022, 18:09:10 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also @MarkEWaite, can you suggest a place to start reading and understanding the code.
08/03/2022, 18:13:06 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Smtng to get started with.
08/03/2022, 18:26:09 - Kris Stern: It may not be a good idea to just ping a particular mentor/org admin so we can all chip in to discuss the matter... It may not be considered polite either. We address the contributors individually out of necessity. 
08/03/2022, 19:02:25 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The caches that are stored in the $JENKINS_HOME/caches directory are initially created by `git clone --bare` and are then updated by `git fetch`.  Not a custom cache format, just bare repositories.

One way to get experience with them is to configure a Jenkins controller, create a GitHub organization folder, and watch what is placed into the `$JENKINS_HOME/caches` folder.

When working on an issue in the issue tracker, do we have to wait till it is assigned to us because maybe someone else working on it? Or is it okay if I start working on it after putting a comment as I'm working on this one
09/03/2022, 04:58:44 - Kris Stern: Hi Wimukti (Wimukthi Indeewara) Unless the issue has been recently assigned to someone and there are telltale signs that it is being actively worked on, you are welcome to tackle any one of them including the assigned ones. Normally once you have opened a PR for any issue within Jenkins ecosystem, you can use it in your GSoC application to indicate why you are qualified to carry out the relevant project. Sometimes an issue might have been abandoned and is no longer worked on, but the changes have not been reflected on the issue. In that case simply write or indicate on the issue that you are interested in / will work on following it up with a PR.

09/03/2022, 08:56:33 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Linux ubuntu 20.04 lts
09/03/2022, 08:57:20 - Kris Stern: Okay, that should be straightforward then
09/03/2022, 08:58:50 - Kris Stern: Should be networking issue, better to double check your SSH key settings
09/03/2022, 09:03:44 - Kris Stern: Be careful to fill the form with your **private** SSH key, in case you have used the public key instead
09/03/2022, 09:04:25 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I used the private key only. I retried the entire process again. The error persists.
09/03/2022, 09:04:28 - halkeye: connection refused is network not credentials
09/03/2022, 09:04:56 - halkeye: on your linux machine, `sudo netstat -npa | grep :22` or `sudo lsof -i :22` to confirm its running and listening
09/03/2022, 09:05:11 - halkeye: is your jenkins controller standalone, or inside a docker container?
09/03/2022, 09:05:25 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): It is standalone
09/03/2022, 09:05:53 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): `sudo lsof -i :22` command doesn't displays any output.
09/03/2022, 09:05:57 - halkeye: okay localhost should work then, yea just confirm sshd is running
09/03/2022, 09:06:58 - Kris Stern: <@hrushi20-62090e486da037398490448d:gitter.im "I used the private key only. I r..."> Check the "Host Key Verification Strategy" too
09/03/2022, 09:07:44 - halkeye: Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): yea it means nothing is listening on port 22, you need to be running an ssh server. 
09/03/2022, 09:07:45 - halkeye: https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-openssh
09/03/2022, 09:11:23 - Kris Stern: I remembered I did encounter some issues the last time I did it on my macOS machine too, so may take some trial and error to get it to work
09/03/2022, 09:15:18 - Kris Stern: Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): When you set remote root directory (e.g.: /home/jenkins), did you already have such a profile available for you to use in the exact location indicated?
09/03/2022, 09:15:56 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Yes. I already had a profile to use. 
09/03/2022, 09:16:35 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I'm am trying to start the ssh server.
09/03/2022, 09:16:46 - Kris Stern: Okay, cool
09/03/2022, 09:18:10 - halkeye: Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): if you don't need to use an ssh agent (not sure what your working on) a jnlp agent is pretty easy, just java -jar agent.jar ... stuff jenkins tells you to, no firewall, no daemons, no nothing. https://github.com/halkeye/home-ansible/blob/main/roles%2Fjenkins-agent%2Ftemplates%2Fjenkins-agent.service.j2 is the systemd template i use (just fill in the values based on what jenkins tells you)
09/03/2022, 09:18:17 - halkeye: if you get ssh working though, then cool, ignore it :)

09/03/2022, 09:23:04 - halkeye: i'm sadly not a java dev, so i can't really help too much with specifics

09/03/2022, 09:56:59 - Ulli Hafner: `IntegrationTestWithJenkinsPerSuite` ist just the base class
09/03/2022, 09:57:41 - Ulli Hafner: It does not use the ending `Test` so that it will not be included in the matchers of surefire and other tools

09/03/2022, 10:04:17 - Ulli Hafner: baruKreddy (baruKreddy): The detection of JUnit 5 tests works in jenkinsci/build-timeout-plugin#88, so where do you still have the problem?
09/03/2022, 10:05:01 - Kris Stern: baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Also, do you have the latest `pom.xml` file you are using so we could check for dependencies

Looks like we are having too many dependencies than is necessary. Have you tried a reductionist way to commenting out some of these to test if they are really necessary? The rule of thumb is not to add a dependency unless it is absolutely required to do so. 
09/03/2022, 12:51:16 - Kris Stern: Also I am not sure how using slashes in branch names, as we tend to use hyphens by convention
09/03/2022, 13:00:10 - Kris Stern: baruKreddy (baruKreddy):  One solution is to change the scope of the existing PR you have opened slightly to address only non-integration tests...

For non-integration tests you can maybe start a new PR.

09/03/2022, 19:51:56 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Thank you! :+1: 
09/03/2022, 20:38:26 - alyssat (Alyssat): Just a reminder to all potential GSoC participants. We discussed this at our last office hours - You should be submitting your proposal around now to the community for review/feedback. Recording to the proposal application demo is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuLk2Nvs5Gw (16:25). There are also helpful links at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit?usp=sharing , under March 4, 2022 @ 3AM UTC [Asia] / Your Application Proposal section.

10/03/2022, 02:12:43 - Kris Stern: I think I got the projects confused, my apologies üòêÔ∏è
10/03/2022, 02:16:48 - Kris Stern: The Meetup video link is here: https://youtu.be/GDRTgEvIVBc
10/03/2022, 03:53:56 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Thank you all for the video links! definitely going through now!
10/03/2022, 03:55:02 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Do we have the next meeting in around 20 min?
10/03/2022, 03:59:49 - Kris Stern: The meeting will be at 2pm UTC March 10th, so will be in 11 hours if my counting is correct
10/03/2022, 04:12:20 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Oh yes, this week is EMEA! 
10/03/2022, 06:30:14 - Hrushikesh: <@hrushi20-62090e486da037398490448d:gitter.im ">One way to get experience with ..."> Hey! Can anybody help me with this.

10/03/2022, 07:08:55 - Kris Stern: If I were you I would consider this a test, and would do some research into the problem on my own so that I will be able to ask some more in-depth questions. This way the chances of getting selected will be greater. 
10/03/2022, 07:11:55 - Aaryan Gautam: <@krisstern:matrix.org "The meeting will be at 2pm UTC M..."> Under march 4th section in the Jenkins office hours doc, there is a mention of office hours on 11th march. Is there another office hour on 11th or is it a type for march 10th?
10/03/2022, 07:11:57 - Aaryan Gautam sent an image. (Media omitted)
10/03/2022, 07:14:21 - Kris Stern: Thanks for pointing it out! I think it was a typo, as we have the Zoom meetings for the EMEA region set for Thursdays. I have just corrected it. 
10/03/2022, 07:17:37 - alyssat (Alyssat): Thanks Kris for the correction. @aaryan-gautam:matrix.org  the next office will take place in a few hours at 2PM UTC
10/03/2022, 07:25:38 - Kris Stern: One thing I am certain though is that you will need to use Jenkins CI with Github webhooks, then set up a view for the chosen Github Organization, and then you can scan the organization for branches and pull requests and run builds on pull requests with Jenkinsfiles, etc. 
10/03/2022, 07:27:10 - Hrushikesh: Thanks for giving me a lead. I'll explore and get back to you. 
10/03/2022, 07:27:38 - Kris Stern: <@hrushi2001:matrix.org "Thanks for giving me a lead. I'l..."> Keep it up! All the best
10/03/2022, 07:39:36 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Hi All, I'm looking forward to work on this https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/automatic-spec-generator-for-jenkins-rest-api/ , I have little hands-on experience on rest API's in microservices!
10/03/2022, 07:41:53 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Can i get any help on where to start and extracting HTTP response
10/03/2022, 07:44:34 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): I have gone through some videos on documenting restful API using swagger. But before that i suppose i need to know how'd i extract API's , request and response.
10/03/2022, 07:45:15 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Please confirm whether i'm on the correct path for solution!
10/03/2022, 07:47:01 - Kris Stern: There is a line in the project idea's page where you will need to give it special attention:
> Generating the expected HTTP responses is a difficult task. The student is expected to study Jenkins core to identify ways to extract them. For example, they could be extracted from Javadocs and annotations.
10/03/2022, 07:47:14 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Yes, noticed it!
10/03/2022, 07:47:24 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): https://javadoc.jenkins.io/component/stapler/
10/03/2022, 07:47:52 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Isn't this is the one of the document?
10/03/2022, 07:49:25 - Kris Stern: That's actually a thing you will need to work towards as a part of the project, to come up with your own proposals on how to specify and generate a functional REST API for the Jenkins core and for the plugins
10/03/2022, 07:50:10 - Kris Stern: But it is not 100% guaranteed that this approach will pan out the way we wish
10/03/2022, 07:50:42 - Kris Stern: So part of it is a feasibility study; if not you will need find alternative ways to make things work
10/03/2022, 07:56:27 - baruKreddy (baruKreddy): Getting it!
10/03/2022, 08:50:17 - Hrushikesh: Hey Kris Stern, I may not be able to attend the office meet but I have few questions to ask. Can I just put my questions here so that it can be discussed in the office meet?
10/03/2022, 08:50:45 - Kris Stern: Yup, sure
10/03/2022, 08:51:10 - Kris Stern: I will bring it up if there will be any questions about it
10/03/2022, 08:53:53 - Kris Stern: Or better still leave these as comments in the Google doc
10/03/2022, 08:54:32 - Kris Stern: And explain you would like some questions answered but are unable to attend personally
10/03/2022, 08:55:07 - Kris Stern: It also depends on what kind of questions you will be asking
10/03/2022, 09:10:35 - Hrushikesh: I just realized the questions can be answered here itself. It's related to the automatic git cache maintenance.  
10/03/2022, 09:11:07 - Hrushikesh: 1. I have gone through the git maintenance documentation on git-scm website. As we won't be implementing the git cli for git maintenance,
we would need to implement the logic in java. 
So is there an architectural guide about this. I have read the entire git-plugin doc but there is nothing mentioned about the repository caching, how and where exactly they are stored etc
10/03/2022, 09:32:16 - Kris Stern: To be honest the best guide to the architecture you will need to know is the Jenkins `Git` plugin codebase itself... But if you mean instead you would like an overview maybe it is better to be present at the office hour say next week to ask the question directly. 
10/03/2022, 09:34:58 - Kris Stern: Or just coincidently may I enquire if both of the alternate office hours does not work for you?
10/03/2022, 09:55:41 - Hrushikesh: Actually both are fine with me. I have no issues with the timings. Got hung up with some work. Still I'll try to attend the office meet üòÑ
10/03/2022, 09:57:26 - Hrushikesh: I would love to get an overview of what is expected from the users and how can we improve the performance of the git repo.

10/03/2022, 12:46:40 - Hrushikesh: Should I start with the git-plugin or git-client-plugin. It would be easier if I also know the starter class(top most class) from where I can start understanding. 
10/03/2022, 12:49:56 - Jmm: I'll let MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) answer specifically for these two plugins.
10/03/2022, 12:50:27 - Jmm: but be aware that plugins use extensively the jenkins plugin framework
10/03/2022, 12:51:08 - Jmm: it can be daughting to understand how it work
10/03/2022, 12:52:15 - Jmm: a good way is to examine the unit/integration tests and put break points to start understanding the innerworking of a plugin
10/03/2022, 12:52:51 - Jmm: I hope that you will get more specific guidance from Mark and others
10/03/2022, 12:54:47 - Hrushikesh: Jmm: Thank you. I have gone through the plugin development guide  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial/. Ig the idea of examining unit tests will be of more help to me.  
10/03/2022, 12:57:08 - Jmm: I was just going to hint to look at the development guide :-)
Remember that plugins are not born equal and thus designed for different purposes (pipeline step, tool integration, libraries, etc).
10/03/2022, 12:57:43 - Jmm: I will look around if I can give you other hints (sorry I don' t know the Git plugin)
10/03/2022, 12:58:26 - Hrushikesh: Sure. Thank you very much üòÅüòÅüòÅ
10/03/2022, 13:10:01 - martinda (Martin d'Anjou): @baruKreddy did you request access to "edit" the project proposal template? I got a request from "barureddy" and I am not sure if it is you or someone else. If you need access to create your application, you should be able to copy the document.
10/03/2022, 13:18:43 - Kris Stern: Hi all, as the application period for GSoC contributors is slated for early next month I thought maybe it is a good time to mention the old guide from Google, especially for those not sure about how to start: https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/making-first-contact

10/03/2022, 14:30:15 - Kris Stern: Reminder: Today's Jenkins Office Hour is taking place in 30 minutes
10/03/2022, 15:00:34 - Hrushikesh: Can somebody share the link. 
10/03/2022, 15:02:30 - Kris Stern: Here: https://zoom.us/j/97478518050?pwd=aENKNXZ4dzUrSDF6UlBDZ2s3UWk4dz09
10/03/2022, 15:16:31 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Don't need to install the deprecated plugin because the GitHub Branch Source provides the correct and current implementation of the organization folder
10/03/2022, 15:52:40 - Jmm: As mentioned during today's GSoC Office Hour, I find this application useful to have a simple visual overview of timezones: https://everytimezone.com/
10/03/2022, 18:05:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Typo for March 10th.  Office hours are posted on the Jenkins calendar at https://www.jenkins.io/events/ .  As far as I read that calendar, the next office hours session will be Friday March 18, 2022 at 3:00 AM UTC.  In my local time zone, that is actually on Thursday March 17, 2022 at 9:00 PM Denver time.
11/03/2022, 02:58:13 - Aaryan Gautam: When will the recording of the office hours for march 10th be uploaded?
11/03/2022, 03:06:26 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Likely in the next 24 hours.
11/03/2022, 03:56:13 - alyssat (Alyssat): @aaryan-gautam:matrix.org   Here is the recording to today's GSoC Office Hours https://youtu.be/osTv_O6C0wk

11/03/2022, 04:01:56 - alyssat (Alyssat): you're very welcome :)
11/03/2022, 07:09:41 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Do we have to implement the git maintenance features for JGit or is it only for the command line git ?
11/03/2022, 07:59:41 - Kris Stern: Better include both the command line version and JGit version as the scope in the proposal unless it turns out not enough time...
11/03/2022, 08:00:31 - Kris Stern: Both implementations will be required eventually
11/03/2022, 08:11:01 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also is the Automatic Git Cache Maintenance user opt in feature or will it be a part of the Jenkins controller by default? If it is user opted, then once the user enables this feature the various caching methods would be implemented. 
11/03/2022, 08:11:45 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thank You. I'll look into JGit :)
11/03/2022, 08:14:29 - Kris Stern: It should be an opt-in feature
11/03/2022, 09:01:56 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Can a few changes be made to the project template or should it be in the same format as in the google doc. I read that few organization are very strict about the format of the proposal. 
11/03/2022, 09:34:18 - Kris Stern: You should conform to the standard format as much as possible, so that when we review all the applications it will be easier for us to carry out the selection process
11/03/2022, 09:44:34 - community-jenkins-io: Jean-Marc Meessen @Jmm posted in Jenkins GSoC 2022 Office Hour - March 10, 2022 - https://community.jenkins.io/t/jenkins-gsoc-2022-office-hour-march-10-2022/1782/1
12/03/2022, 09:53:05 - Aaryan Gautam: For the project proposal, can I first upload a draft which only includes my implementation details so that I can refine my implementation based on the feedback before I write out other details of my proposal?
12/03/2022, 10:11:47 - Kris Stern: You may if you feel the non-implementation related details are yet to be supplied or do not need reviewing, but we encourage you to finish a complete first draft of the proposal first before submitting to Discourse at community.jenkins.io via https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/gsoc/6. Remember to indicate this in your Discourse post as a note, so that we will know if you like us to review the implementation details only at this stage.
12/03/2022, 11:31:44 - Aaryan Gautam: I will keep this in mind. Thank you
12/03/2022, 11:58:12 - Aaryan Gautam: With regards to JIRA-32143, I want to create a test with a large repository size. After looking at GitSCMFileSystemTest and AbstractGitSCMSourceTest, I was planning on inserting a lot of text in a sample repo to achieve this. What would be a good methodology to follow to create a repository with a large size?

Some issues will inevitably crop up, like how well it is maintained, how much dependence are you going to rely on their org maintaining the repo, etc. 
12/03/2022, 12:33:33 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): There is an instruction in the README of `jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator` as:
>Next, run the following commands from this repository (with others in relative positions):
```
rm -v ../jenkins.io/content/doc/pipeline/steps/*.adoc
```

However, the [directory](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/tree/master/content/doc/pipeline/steps) mentioned above doesn't have any file with an extension of `.adoc`. What is the purpose of this instruction?
12/03/2022, 12:36:18 - Kris Stern: <@vihaanthora-61dfc3eb6da03739848e38e0:gitter.im "There is an instruction in the R..."> I think we have been through this question before and I have already checked for you the lines are still there in the jenkins.io repo
12/03/2022, 12:37:43 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Actually, this is something different. It was regarding patching jenkins.io, but here, we wish to remove all the pipeline step documentation in the form of asciidocs.
12/03/2022, 12:39:31 - Kris Stern: The lines are here you will need to remove: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/e3617f806cdcaafba0202ada1867012afc275f3a/scripts/fetch-external-resources#L35-L40
12/03/2022, 12:40:33 - Kris Stern: If you do not remove these lines first it will not work
12/03/2022, 12:41:58 - Kris Stern: We did run all the commands (and me included) and those docs are there after the steps above
12/03/2022, 12:42:23 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I have removed these lines and created a Makefile as instructed. Is there anything else that needs to be done apart from these before running the remove asciidoc command?
12/03/2022, 12:43:22 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I mean there are no such files in the repository in the first place, why are we removing them?
12/03/2022, 12:44:04 - Kris Stern: No, I have a feeling it is there just to make sure all the `.adoc` files will be removed
12/03/2022, 12:44:39 - Kris Stern: Alternatively you can try running the procedure without that line
12/03/2022, 12:47:03 - Kris Stern: But for the documentation's sake the line better be preserved because it is there as a double-checking mechanism. 
12/03/2022, 12:48:03 - Kris Stern: Cause if you re-run the whole process multiple times there might be some `.adoc` files there
12/03/2022, 12:49:20 - Kris Stern: If you are coming from the perspective of doing it for the first time true it won't seem to make a difference
12/03/2022, 12:52:27 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Oh okay, this makes sense, thank you :)
12/03/2022, 12:53:44 - Kris Stern: The goal of of the steps is to populate the `jenkins.io/content/doc/pipeline/steps` with `.adoc`s

12/03/2022, 12:54:13 - Kris Stern: You are welcome, my apologies I am multitasking so it took some time for the answer to be developed

This means you can use it but you will need to give proper citations, so you could fork their repo and make new developments based on this. You will then be responsible for complying with the terms of the license and the maintenance of your new version/variant. At least this is one solution. 
12/03/2022, 13:04:40 - Kris Stern: Better bring this up next time we meet during the weekly Office Hour for discussion.

For example, if we try to expose more data in depth=1 maybe it's getting too verbose. But some of the issues suggested exposing more data for a particular depth even though they can be fetched by increasing the depth parameter. In that case, do we really need to expose them as those are more data than it used to have for that particular depth?

13/03/2022, 00:12:06 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I suspect that you're running on Windows and that you have an entry in your PATH that includes Java 1.8.0_211 in the "Program Files" folder.  That build system is probably not ready for paths that include space characters.  You might try temporarily modifying the PATH to not include space characters by using the 8.3 short form of the "Program Files"  directory name
13/03/2022, 01:12:43 - Kris Stern: vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I think maybe it would be a good idea for you to open a PR and rework the README since the information there can still be confusing and incomplete. Also, the command you tried only works for Linux / macOS only.
13/03/2022, 01:14:47 - Kris Stern: That way you will have a PR to include with your application as well

13/03/2022, 01:57:59 - Kris Stern: I think normally with a task like this it would be better to find a third-party repo that is very large and fork/clone it instead of starting from scratch. I am not sure adding text to the repo to modify it would have the effect of significantly beefing up the size of the repo. Also, when it comes to testing you may want something more "real" to simulate a real-world situation a user in the wild might encounter.
13/03/2022, 02:55:42 - Aaryan Gautam: <@krisstern:matrix.org "I think normally with a task lik..."> What can I do to find such a third-party repo?  Should I make a PR for a new test class for a large repository test? I believe that it would be useful for projects like git automatic cache maintenance.
Are there any third party repo or large repository currently used in the git plugin?
13/03/2022, 04:29:37 - Kris Stern: I think you may want to go search for some large repo that works in your case since you may need to try out different ones before settling on the best one. It depends on what you are trying to achieve, the `git` merge timeout feature can be introduced without having to use a real large repo in the test as you can mock the outcome. (You may not need to mock the error at all in fact.) So the large repo is only for your development use, and you do not need or want to link to, reference, cite it for the testing.
13/03/2022, 08:08:21 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Ah yes! how could I not figure that out üòÖ Thanks a lot, this step is running smoothly now.
13/03/2022, 08:09:15 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Sure @krisstern:matrix.org , I was thinking the same! I would love to make the README more user-friendly :)
13/03/2022, 08:10:02 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): May I send a PR directly, or is there a need to raise an issue first?
13/03/2022, 08:47:07 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I had 2 questions: 
1) Why does the `make` process of `jenkins.io` require us to build/run/push to the docker image of `jenkins-infra`? Can we simply comment out those lines in the `Makefile` in order to test if  `jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator` is working correctly or not?
2) I ran that makefile (which is the final step in the [README](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator/blob/master/README.md)) and was facing an error:
```
docker: Error response from daemon: the working directory 'C:/Personal/Programs/PipelineStepDoc/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io' is invalid, it needs to be an absolute path.
```
I found out that this error occurs when you try to run a Linux container under a Windows host, and this is an unresolved issue on the [JIRA](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60473). This probably occurs due to the difference in path styles of Linux and Windows, as discussed in https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/2204. Is there an easy hack for this, that is perhaps used by other Windows users, who wish to run the `Makefile`?
 
13/03/2022, 08:53:54 - Kris Stern: Actually the line in the code
```
IMAGE=jenkinsci/schedule-build-plugin
```

is redundant. If you look closely this `IMAGE` variable is never used in the body. 

Also can you please provide the exact command you ran in place of the Linux/macOS version, so we can see what you did to understand your situation better? You can write your own script in CMD or PowerShell to achieve a similar effect I believe.
13/03/2022, 08:56:52 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Actually, I use Git Bash for running Linux commands in Windows, and I ran all the given commands in that, without making any change.
13/03/2022, 08:58:02 - Kris Stern: Alternatively you can just manually or run commands line-by-line to copy the plugins. This shouldn't be too difficult to do. 
13/03/2022, 08:59:03 - Kris Stern: <@vihaanthora-61dfc3eb6da03739848e38e0:gitter.im "Actually, I use Git Bash for run..."> In that case you will have to double-check the paths you are using in that command is valid for your setup
13/03/2022, 08:59:37 - Kris Stern: Or if according to you it is a Docker-related issue you might need to do some refactoring
13/03/2022, 09:00:22 - Kris Stern: Windows has a drastically different organisation of its filesystem
13/03/2022, 09:01:03 - Kris Stern: So what usually works in Linux and in some cases macOS does not apply to Windows
13/03/2022, 09:05:42 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): There should not be anything wrong with the paths, the `Makefile` for `schedule-build-plugin` is getting executed nicely.  
13/03/2022, 09:05:45 - Kris Stern: For a reference you can see like this: https://www.guru99.com/linux-differences.html

13/03/2022, 09:08:18 - Kris Stern: I mean for the command
```

```
13/03/2022, 09:09:38 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): This is also getting built without any errors. It's just the `Makefile` of `jenkins.io` (Docker) that is causing issues.
13/03/2022, 09:09:41 - Kris Stern: If that worked perfectly and you are sure the command `make -C ../jenkins.io run` is causing you problems. Probably you will need to check the config for Docker.
13/03/2022, 09:09:59 - Kris Stern: I just wanted to make sure I checked every step you tried
13/03/2022, 09:10:11 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Yes, I will look into this and let you know. Thanks.
13/03/2022, 09:11:11 - Kris Stern: Sadly I don't have access to a Windows computer so cannot try and reproduce your error

13/03/2022, 11:17:07 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I agree with the advice from @krisstern:matrix.org about only using a large repository for your interactive testing rather than for an automated test.  I doubt that you'll be able to find a testing repository where the merge operation will fail due to timeout without some mock or other delay.  I guess you could grab the Linux kernel from https://github.com/torvalds/linux then create one branch that modifies every file in the kernel by adding text to the start of a file, another branch that modifies every file in the kernel by adding text to the end of the file, then merge those two branches.  Don't want that as an automated test, but it is likely to be slow, even on high performance file systems.
13/03/2022, 13:33:20 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): The error when I run it using cmd or PowerShell is different:
```
make -C ../jenkins.io run
```
```
make: Entering directory 'C:/Personal/Programs/PipelineStepDoc/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io'
Access denied - .

make: *** [Makefile:85: build/ruby] Error 2
make: Leaving directory 'C:/Personal/Programs/PipelineStepDoc/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io' 
```
This error seems unrelated to the path style difference, doesn't it?
13/03/2022, 13:50:05 - Kris Stern: I am already checked with you and you already said it should not be related to paths, so why are you asking me now?

13/03/2022, 14:39:29 - Kris Stern: If after making sure admin rights first the files still cannot be found then it should be path issues.
13/03/2022, 14:40:46 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I see, I ran it with admin rights, the error persists, then it must be a path related issue. On it now.

13/03/2022, 14:41:27 - Kris Stern: Okay, I know how frustrating it is to work with Windows sometimes when it comes to paths

13/03/2022, 21:37:05 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Small doubt regarding the implementation of the git plugin. When we select a particular extension (like CleanBeforeCheckout), how are we registering that extension and running that code during build time. How does jenkins know that it should run that extension? What exactly is happening when a jenkins build is run and  how exactly is the git plugin getting activated and running? I am thinking of creating an extension named git maintenance which would contain all the required feature to improve the performance. Not sure how my extension would be called during build time.

I'm interested in the project "Jenkinsfile Runner Action for GitHub Actions". I haven't used Jenkins before but I have used other related CI/CD pipeline like github actions and Travis CI. I think Jenkins can define people's development workflow in fine grain, which is great! Now I spend amount of time on understanding this project based on previous works. I want to share my understanding to check whether it's correct. What we want to do is to make CI/CD pipleline like github action run the customer defined Jenkins workflow inside. In this process, we might need to package a pre-defined docker container to run this workflow because the github action service will need this to run your own workflow. I see somebody have shown it is feasible. So this project wants to integrate this feature inside the Jenkinsfile Runner and it can make users' life easier. Is that correct?

15/03/2022, 06:31:06 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hello World! I came up with a way of implementing the git cache maintenance. 
I am planning to create an extension in the git-plugin which extends the GitSCMExtension. 
This extension contains the required configuration the user requires to maintain an efficient repository. 
The fundamental working of the extension is based on cron jobs. Based on the command input given to the cron job, the extension will execute  and maintain the repository periodically. 
Any ideas or suggestions on the implementation? 

15/03/2022, 06:52:08 - Kris Stern: LOL, I thought you just said you came up with a way of implementing the `git` cache maintenance feature? Then you should have some ideas about the details of the implementation.

15/03/2022, 08:38:50 - Kris Stern: But the details such as implementation would be expected to be at least slightly different across proposals. I think if you can come up with a very detailed proposal draft on the same idea to us first you may actually have an advantage. 
15/03/2022, 08:42:04 - Kris Stern: This is because the one who comes up with the original idea would normally be ranked more highly than someone with the same details in their proposal submitted later, even if they come up with the proposals independently.

because you may need to repackage the existing Jenkins Runner as Docker after tweaking it to update it. Other then that, yes that's the basic idea.
15/03/2022, 13:49:41 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): I understand it.

I am not familiar with the matter so let me try to help by thinking together with you.
What leads you to think that these extensions are the one (and only one) to use to implement the GC? Have you found articles that explain functionally the GC? I would try to find the code of a recent git version that implements it.
If you already tried it, what did your research lead you too ?
16/03/2022, 22:20:22 - Aaryan Gautam: <@jmmeessen:matrix.org "Hi Aaryan,"> Hi Jmm ,  When I say that I plan to use these extensions, I meant to imply that these extensions would be incorporated within my git gc to implement the prune functionality which is run before the git gc starts to optimize the data. For instance, the scm git gc at https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc states in the description section that git gc removes "unreachable objects which may have been created from prior invocations of git add, packing refs, pruning reflog, rerere metadata or stale working trees". In addition to this, an article from Atlassian (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-gc) mentions that "git gc is a parent command and git prune is a child. git gc will internally trigger git prune" and shows that git gc can have an optional variable called gc.pruneExpire in its configuration. I am considering to borrow the functionality that is provided by the classes that I mentioned to implement this part of the git gc command before the gc would move on to reduce disk space by compressing file revisions. From my understanding of the codebase and (https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/multibranch-pipeline-template-syntax-guide/git), the CleanCheckout would remove the untracked files. Please let me know if my understanding is correct or if I should provide more details.
16/03/2022, 22:30:41 - Jmm: That sounds well documented and sound, Aaryan Gautam üëçÔ∏è
Let me read it in details as well as referenced documentation. It looks very interesting and informative.
Another thing we could explore is to build a test case/repo and compare GC's result with the sequential subcommands result. Try to explore the problem through the test case aspect. This could bring interesting things.
I'll read your documentation tomorrow (it is getting late here)
16/03/2022, 22:54:40 - Aaryan Gautam: <@jmmeessen:matrix.org "That sounds well documented and ..."> Thank you Jean-marc. I will start exploring the test case repo.

17/03/2022, 15:13:49 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think that you are on the right course by considering implementing garbage collection in much the same way that the prune action is implemented.  There are some important differences.  I believe the prune action is only usable in the context of the fetch operation, while garbage collection needs to be available as an independent action, more like fetch than prune.  I'm not looking at the source code, so I may be wrong, but I think that you want to review https://javadoc.io/doc/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit/latest/org.eclipse.jgit/org/eclipse/jgit/api/GarbageCollectCommand.html as an example of the API that JGit created for garbage collection

18/03/2022, 03:29:17 - Aaryan Gautam: At Atlassian (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-prune), I found a short excerpt stating the different prune operations. When you mention that the prune action is only usable in the context of the fetch operation, do you mean that the one currently implemented in the extensions uses the "git fetch --prune" which makes it only usable under the fetch operation? and I should be implementing the generic git prune which would make garbage collection available as an independent action?

19/03/2022, 08:58:18 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hello World! I am facing a problem regarding scheduling the git-maintenance using cron jobs. I need to register the cron job globally to the jenkins controller so that the jenkins controller can perform the git-maintenance periodically. Is there any plugin or class where I can register my cron job so that it can be scheduled and run later?
19/03/2022, 09:03:52 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): I have gone through plugin https://github.com/jenkinsci/schedule-build-plugin and it was only for build.
19/03/2022, 09:33:18 - Kris Stern: Just out of curiosity: Can you adapt the code with a scheduler so instead of building you would be maintaining with something like [ScheduleMaintainAction.java](https://github.com/jenkinsci/schedule-build-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/schedulebuild/ScheduleBuildAction.java)?
19/03/2022, 13:00:40 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Ig the above plugin is not for cron jobs . It is based on the time provided. I had a look at this plugin https://github.com/jenkinsci/parameterized-scheduler-plugin. This has a java class named Cron.java.
19/03/2022, 13:10:19 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also my gsoc proposal doesn't contains the JGit implementation for now, is it fine to submit the proposal for the Git Cli architecture?
19/03/2022, 13:12:48 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Due to unfinished jgit implementation in the proposal, I didn't complete the timeline schedule in the proposal as well..
19/03/2022, 13:41:52 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I was trying to note that the `prune` operations currently implemented in the git plugin and git client plugin are removing stale remote tracking branches.  Removing a stale remote tracking branch (with either `git fetch --prune origin` or `git remote prune origin`) is a very different operation than the operation performed by `git gc --prune`.  As far as I know, there is no implementation of garbage collection in the git plugin or the git client plugin yet.

I believe your original question was, "Should a gc implementation also perform a prune?" When https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc describes `--prune` it says that it is "on by default".  I think it would be enough to call `git maintenance --task=gc` and rely on the underlying git implementation to decide if it should prune or not
19/03/2022, 13:45:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): It is fine to begin with a proposal that only considers the command line git implementation, though we'll probably work with you to refine the proposal so that it includes a JGit implementation.  Command line git is the reference implementation and is the most feature complete implementation.  JGit implements a subset of the command line git features.  The subset is a usable and useful subset, but it is a subset.
19/03/2022, 13:47:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I was wondering this morning if we need a new Jenkins job type as a concept, since we have something that needs to be run periodically but we don't want to clutter the experience of the administrator or the users by presenting it as separate jobs in the Jenkins UI.
19/03/2022, 14:14:25 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I've been thinking that it might be helpful to have a 60 minute brainstorming session next week for anyone that is interested in the git caching project idea.  I've started capturing discussion topics and ideas in a Google Doc at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpeIX75i5ylM068JsMdhB8npuS7EEkIANdCmpLN_Yzo/edit# .  Are others interested in attending that sort of brainstorming workshop so that we can discuss each other's ideas?
19/03/2022, 14:15:30 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @MarkEWaite I am interested in attending the brainstorming workshop. Would love to share my ideas.
19/03/2022, 15:03:08 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @MarkEWaite, my implementation of the git-maintenance is an extension. Should I wait for the brainstorming session and then update the proposal or can I submit the proposal by this week? My implementation of the git-maintenance is a bit different from what you have stated in the above google doc. 
19/03/2022, 15:11:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Don't delay sharing your ideas for the brainstorming session @Hrushi20 .  The more discussions we have, the better the ideas will be.
19/03/2022, 15:13:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I'm still trying to think through the administrator experience in the brainstorming document.  You're welcome to add comments or questions to the brainstorming document so that we assure that the brainstorming session covers topics of interest.

19/03/2022, 20:10:47 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I had a question:
Does the pipeline snippet generator and the pipeline steps document generator fetch the available steps to a jenkins instance similarly?

Motivation behind the question:
The tasks performed by the two are quite similar.

P.S. @kwhetstone explained about the way the generator works in an office hour, but I guess that this might not have been covered.
20/03/2022, 00:39:58 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, conceptually.  The Pipeline snippet generator looks for plugins that are in the current Jenkins installation and then uses them to provide the snippets.  The pipeline steps doc generator loads all plugins and then uses them to generate the documentation
20/03/2022, 00:52:38 - halkeye: doesn't the generator actually like compile things, so it can actually get compile time annotations, not just runtime ones?
20/03/2022, 00:58:24 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I thought that it was only loading the plugins with an approximation of the plugin manager, so it was relying on the plugin file to be fully compiled. I could be wrong though. @kwhetstone would know for sure
20/03/2022, 00:59:59 - halkeye: yea i donno, i thought the job on ci.jenkins compiled, while syntax generator on the sidebar was mostly @symbol based, but saying it outloud, it doesn't make sense to be different
20/03/2022, 02:22:32 - Aaryan Gautam: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "It is fine to begin with a propo..."> I understand that the git gc implementation will have less flexibility than the jgit implementation as the git cli would have a fixed amount of commands while jgit would allow us to have more control over the microdetails. Is the goal of the project for one over the other? I am planning to implement the gitcli until there is something that the git cli cannot implement like the git gc at which point I will utilize the jgit and implement the details.
20/03/2022, 02:33:40 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I believe it will most likely be the other direction.  Command line git provides more options and more implementation than JGit.
20/03/2022, 07:12:15 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I see...., I checked the code and as @kwhetstone mentioned, it loads a mock jenkins instance and searches for the plugins to generate the documentation. I think it is a jenkins instance that contains all the plugins, thus returning all the plugins' documentation, just how a pipeline snippet generator would.
20/03/2022, 08:16:36 - Kris Stern: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "I've been thinking that it might..."> +1
20/03/2022, 08:56:44 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Am I correct in assuming that the line
>Many of the Pipeline step references include no documentation. Those pages could have a standard reference created that directs the reader to use the Pipeline Syntax snippet generator. See the git plugin documentation for one idea of a way to encourage use of the snippet generator.

means that instead of returning none for such steps, we have to instead show a hyperlink that leads the user to the [snippet generator](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#snippet-generator) page?

20/03/2022, 12:53:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I was just thinking of having the tool insert a paragraph or two of text that guides the user to the pipeline syntax generator.  Pipeline development without the pipeline syntax generator is much more diffiicult
20/03/2022, 18:39:44 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora):  I was wondering that instead of putting the same text everywhere the documentation is absent, it would be better to direct them to the syntax generator page. By adding the guide about the steps, do you mean that we should add an example for the steps using the syntax generator?
20/03/2022, 20:07:59 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): That is something which is highly suggested by the users in the feedback form :'o
20/03/2022, 21:02:03 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I was thinking of common text that directs them to the pipeline syntax generator page.  If there is a way to automatically generate a useful example and insert it, that would be great.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to automatically generate a useful example.

The git plugin documentation at https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/#plugin-content-pipelines encourages the reader to watch a 90 second pipeline syntax generator video.  In the 14 months since it was created, it has been viewed over 5000 times.  That's many more views than were expected for that video
20/03/2022, 21:02:47 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Users in the feedback forum would like to have many more examples.  However, many more examples means that we need plugin maintainers or other contributors to provide those examples.
20/03/2022, 21:06:07 - halkeye: MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): wonder if we can modify the "function not found" error message to mention syntax generator
20/03/2022, 21:06:55 - halkeye: MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): and while I agree, it may have less Todo with syntax generator and more Todo with it being on the git page.
20/03/2022, 21:11:50 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Yes, even that's something I've been pondering on. It is not possible to automatically generate examples, perhaps the best we can do (and what the aim of the GSoC project seems to be) is improve the non-content part. 
Another set of user feedback talks about how the use of the parameters in a step should be specified in the documentation, but again, it boils down to the fact that it should be provided by the plugin contributors in the first place.
20/03/2022, 21:13:59 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I will work on the empty steps part, and would hopefully send a PR to add common text like the git plugin very soon :)
20/03/2022, 21:14:34 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @halkeye:g4v.dev I'm not sure which "function not found" error message you are referencing.  Can you give me more context?  I certainly agree that the video view count may be more due to the specific plugin than the topic of the video.  The other video on that page (multibranch pipeline) has 3x more views than the pipeline syntax video
20/03/2022, 21:16:11 - halkeye: MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): like the error message in Jenkins core. Instead of saying foo doesn't exist in "large block of steps" we include syntax generator first or something
20/03/2022, 21:23:10 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Yes, this idea seems to be pretty solid. We can take a step further and embed the video help via a link or something along with the error message. I think it will be much more convenient for the users that way.
20/03/2022, 21:31:47 - halkeye: i don't think we want to embed video links inside of jenkins core, jenkins is kinda designed to support being airgapped (no internet needed)

I haven‚Äôt been in an open-source community before so really excited to be part of Jenkins! I have used python-jenkins in one of my previous internships to extract the time left and some other information of a Jenkins build for the API of a web tool. I felt like Jenkins would be a powerful automation tool for CI/CD but unfortunately I was unable to get to know more about it during that time. So I believe GSoC would be a perfect opportunity for me to pick it up and learn about it more! The project I am interested in is the ‚ÄúPlugin Installation Manager Tool Improvements‚Äù. I have some paid experience in both Java and Docker and I have spent a good amount of time reading the requirements. I have downloaded the jar file and played around with it according to the README and ran some tests provided in src file. I wonder if you guys have any specific recommendations for me to get on with the project or should I try to solve this issue https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/365?

21/03/2022, 13:53:03 - Jmm: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a program, sponsored by Google, to learn this under the friendly supervision of mentors.

21/03/2022, 18:06:17 - Aaryan Gautam: For the automatic git cache maintenance, I wanted to ask why we are pursuing the jgit implementation if the CLI git provides everything?
21/03/2022, 18:37:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @aaryan-gautam:matrix.org we've tried to retain feature parity between the JGit and the CLI git implementations when we can.  Because we retained feature parity where possible, we were able in GSoC 2020 to automatically choose the highest performing git implementation based on the size of a repository.  @rishabhBudhouliya implemented that.  The plugin chooses to use JGit automatically when a repository is less than 5 MB and chooses automatically to use CLI git if the repository is more than 5 MB.  Similar reason to have automatic git cache maintenance in both implementations.
21/03/2022, 21:07:01 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): @vihaanthora  yes there are 2 different functions to generate the 2 different types of syntax because declarative pipeline syntax is different than the scripted
21/03/2022, 21:08:04 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): All the conversion to Asciidoc format which is what is used by the website is done here: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/pipeline_steps_doc_generator/ToAsciiDoc.java
21/03/2022, 21:08:36 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Generating the style of documentation help for scripted: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/pipeline_steps_doc_generator/PipelineStepExtractor.java#L250
21/03/2022, 21:09:09 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Is going to look a bit different than declarative: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/pipeline_steps_doc_generator/PipelineStepExtractor.java#L283
21/03/2022, 21:11:13 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Something that might help a bit is starting a Jenkins instance and looking at the snippet generator.
21/03/2022, 21:16:01 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Something else to do is look at the generated files for the declarative stuff: it's more about pulling out the basics of what's in core
21/03/2022, 21:16:33 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone):  There's a file for "when" and "agent"
21/03/2022, 21:19:01 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): The https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/pipeline_steps_doc_generator/PipelineStepExtractor.java#L250 generates this: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/  
21/03/2022, 21:19:16 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Hi @krisstern:matrix.org! Recently, I set up a spring-boot test project for my idea. Under my experiment, here are the steps the users need to do with:
1. configure a github action workflow: You need to set up the docker image here (Now I have used the pre-built image in my own docker hub and users don't need to do other things actually). Set up the relative path for the plugins.txt and Jenkinsfile under the project root path.
2. push to the github repo to trigger the Jenkins pipeline under the pre-built container.

So now I simplify this idea that the user only needs to write yaml file for github actions. However, the user needs to point out the relative path of plugins.txt and Jenkinsfile in that yaml file. It's pretty simple now but we can change the jenkinsfile-runner so that the user doesn't need to point out the path in the yaml file. My idea is to add this new feature for jenkinsfile-runner and user can use jenkinsfile-runner to set it up in the command line. What's your opinion?

My test project is private. If you want to see it, I can invite you to the repo. Thanks for your help!
21/03/2022, 21:19:55 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Message deleted
21/03/2022, 21:22:54 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): One hint of what's going on is to look in the generated files: the declarative ones are pulling out the extra declarative steps like "node" and "pipeline" from core.
21/03/2022, 21:23:37 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Basically I look at it like it should be somewhere else
21/03/2022, 21:26:38 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Where the too starts to get interesting is here: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/pipeline_steps_doc_generator/PipelineStepExtractor.java#L116 
21/03/2022, 21:28:34 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): that's the line that pulls all the components that have `StepDescrptor` aka: a pipeline annotation out to start generating the documentation
21/03/2022, 21:29:00 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Two reasons why I choose to use "container" context not the pre-defined "action.yml":
1. Pre-defined actions needs user to write unrelated codes.
2. Container context cancels the function of entrypoint and user might want to use it to do other things.
21/03/2022, 21:31:59 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): For simplicity (or what you're trying to do) you can ignore the declarative stuff.  I'll add a GitHub issue to clean that out of the main class.
21/03/2022, 21:33:16 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Now I think the features for jenkinsfile-runner are limited üòü

21/03/2022, 22:56:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I've posted a proposed time for the automatic git cache maintenance brainstorming session at https://community.jenkins.io/t/git-cache-maintenance-project-idea-brainstorming-session/1875 Proposed Wed March 23, 2022 at 02:00 UTC
21/03/2022, 23:02:28 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): @krisstern:matrix.org I want to start to write the proposal now based on my current ideas and understanding. Feel free to give me advices about my recent works~ There might be something wrong with my understanding. And I make my test repo from private to public now (https://github.com/Cr1t-GYM/JekinsTest). Thanks!
21/03/2022, 23:41:30 - justcrossheaven (justcrossheaven): Hi teams! @MarkEWaite Sorry for the bother but just wondering whether https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/365 is still good to be fixed? It seems that both https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/pull/399 and  https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/pull/400 has resolved the issue. I've also tried to reproduce this issue through docker image and it seems to work fine now. 
21/03/2022, 23:48:01 - justcrossheaven (justcrossheaven): 
21/03/2022, 23:48:54 - justcrossheaven (justcrossheaven): Also, some of the tests might fail under JDK 16 with InaccessibleObjectException. Specifically like below. I assume this is because some of the modules might be outdated under the newest environment? It works fine under 1.8 and 11 though. Do you have any suggestions on this?
21/03/2022, 23:49:21 - justcrossheaven (justcrossheaven): [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/OAZs/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/OAZs/image.png)
21/03/2022, 23:51:40 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): We don't test or support JDK 16.  Java 17 support is in preview currently and would be an interesting case to test.  Basil Crow and Tim Jacomb have made a number of changes to allow Java 17 in many Jenkins components.  I'm not aware of anyone running Java 17 tests with plugin installation manager tool
22/03/2022, 01:55:07 - justcrossheaven (justcrossheaven): Thanks for your reply. I just gave it a go and some tests fail for the same reason as running under JDK 16. I wonder if supporting Java 17 would be a potential improvement for this tool.

You could do as we suggest which is to seek our suggestions on your proposal draft. The application steps can be found at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/#application-steps. You should be able to copy the template there and use it for your proposal.

22/03/2022, 03:04:08 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Certainly would be a good improvement.
22/03/2022, 05:54:25 - Aaryan Gautam: I was reviewing the git gc scm page and found that git gc was introduced in 2.4.12. Since centos7 supports version 1.8 of the command line git, it would not be compatible. So I should be providing the implementation for the git gc command as well?
22/03/2022, 05:54:28 - Aaryan Gautam sent an image. (Media omitted)
22/03/2022, 06:00:03 - Hrushikesh: Aaryan Gautam: can you confirm once again. I downloaded centos7 using docker and ran the container. Git gc command was available on centos7. I'll also try confirming from my side once again üòÑ
22/03/2022, 06:07:11 - Kris Stern: Hi Aaryan, I think that is exactly what Mark intended and have mentioned in passing before if that is indeed the case.
22/03/2022, 06:09:50 - Kris Stern: I did check and confirm that

I will look into all this and get back to you if I have any follow-ups. 
22/03/2022, 07:22:37 - Udbhavbisarya23 (Udbhavbisarya23) joined the room
22/03/2022, 07:22:38 - Udbhavbisarya23 (Udbhavbisarya23): Hi all, 
I am Udbhav Bisarya, a 4th-year undergraduate student based in India. I am quite new to the world of open source and am very excited to be a part of Jenkins. I have worked with Jenkins before in my internship and I can't wait to be part of this community.  I have prior experience with Java but I'm hoping to take the next step and become proficient in this language through the course of GSoC. Since I have worked with API documentation and extraction before, I would like to take up the "Automatic Specification Generator for Jenkins REST API " project. I would really appreciate if you could guide me in this aspect and give me some advice on how to get started. Thanks all!
22/03/2022, 07:27:25 - AbhyudayaSharma (Abhyudaya Sharma) joined the room
22/03/2022, 07:27:25 - AbhyudayaSharma (Abhyudaya Sharma): Hi @Udbhavbisarya23. I would suggest you to go through the [project description](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/automatic-spec-generator-for-jenkins-rest-api/). Also take a look at https://github.com/jenkinsci/stapler/ which is the web framework used by Jenkins and the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/)
22/03/2022, 07:31:12 - Udbhavbisarya23 (Udbhavbisarya23): Sure, I will go through it now! Thank you!!
22/03/2022, 07:33:18 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Aah now I see, earlier I was not considering `node` as a step, and thought that the steps written inside the stages are written in the same manner for both syntaxes, so why is there a need to have different documentation for that. But now, I think I am getting it.
22/03/2022, 07:40:58 - halkeye: kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): I know it's a little off topic but do you know how hard it would be to get/make a list of pipeline steps to Jenkins.Io URLs?
22/03/2022, 08:12:56 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): @halkeye:g4v.dev I checked the code and the below lines populate the index page of `pipeline/steps` with all the hyperlinks. 
```HAML
%ul
    - sections_from(steps_dir).sort_by { |it| it[0].downcase }.each do |section, file, url, children|
      %li
        %a{:href => url}
          = section
        %ul
          - children.each do |section, file, sect_url, sect_children|
            %li
              %a{:href => "#{url}##{sect_url}"}
                = section
```
We can extract the links in this step to make the list that you have mentioned. Is this what you require?
22/03/2022, 09:21:09 - halkeye: Okay so I think that parses the asciidoc but totally a way of doing it. Hrmmm hrmmm
22/03/2022, 10:17:14 - Aaryan Gautam: It seems that the git scm page only provides versions that are 2 and above. I went to the git documentation in github and searched for the git gc and found it existing in some versions older than 1.8
https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation/RelNotes
22/03/2022, 13:56:43 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The `git gc` command is available on CentOS 7 with command line git 1.8.3.1.  I checked with a CentOS 7.9 machine to confirm it is available.

The concept of garbage collection has been part of command line git almost since the beginning of the git project.  It is one of the ways that command line git is intentionally different than subversion and other centralized SCM tools.  Frequent operations are intentionally optimized for speed while accepting that the speed optimizations can require periodic garbage collection.
22/03/2022, 14:32:40 - arpoch (Harshit Chopra): You can checkout this link  to see git docs for v1.8.3.1 https://code.google.com/archive/p/git-core/downloads?page=5

22/03/2022, 19:25:36 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): it probably wouldn't be too hard.  Each plugin has it's own asciifile and follows the format https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/<plugin-name>
22/03/2022, 19:27:46 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): in case it's easier to reply here: @halkeye:g4v.dev getting plugin-to-jenkins.io page probably wouldn't be too hard.  Each plugin has it's own asciifile and follows the format https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/<plugin-name> so since we know the plugins, we know it'll have a page there

23/03/2022, 05:04:37 - Kris Stern: Aaryan Gautam: Are you resolving "comments" on Mark's document? 
23/03/2022, 05:06:48 - Kris Stern: Would better for Mark to mark these as resolved as most are addressed to him
23/03/2022, 05:14:35 - Aaryan Gautam: I must have accidentally resolved some while trying to view them
23/03/2022, 07:15:28 - Kris Stern: <@cr1t-gym-622f8c3d6da0373984924b73:gitter.im "Hi @krisstern:matrix.org and oth..."> Hi Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t) I have had a look at your proposal and it looks great! However, I have a small request to make though: Would it be possible for you to make your Google doc available for commenting? That way it would be easier for us to make suggestions for changes. 
23/03/2022, 14:10:51 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I was brainstorming some ideas for pipeline step doc improvements, and I was facing a doubt: Should we redirect the user for only specific parameters within a step such as `scm ` of `checkout` step of `workflow-scm-step` , or all the parameters which have a nested choice of objects under them? I am not able to convince myself with one architecture as all the steps differ quite significantly, and some of their parameters are much more verbose compared to the others. 
23/03/2022, 14:13:33 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I have thought of a few different options, but none of them would suit some exceptional steps such as `checkout`, and the only possible way to deal with such steps would be to hardcode a different logic for them. Is this what is expected also?
23/03/2022, 15:11:34 - Kris Stern: <@vihaanthora-61dfc3eb6da03739848e38e0:gitter.im "I have thought of a few differen..."> Hopefully kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone) will be available soon to offer some insights into this design problem. 
23/03/2022, 15:40:42 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think that custom handling of exceptional steps seems reasonable to me.  If the step has more than 5 (or some other number) implementations, it gets a different layout that acknowledges the special challenge of that many implementations
23/03/2022, 15:59:23 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Okay, I will think over the entire design tonight and get back with a suitable one tomorrow, so that it can get reviewed here and then I can perhaps include that in my proposal.
23/03/2022, 16:08:07 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Hi @krisstern:matrix.org, sorry for the inconvenience. I just made it available for commenting~

23/03/2022, 19:37:35 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Well, one possible problem associated with creating a separate web page for every SCM in `checkout` would be that some of them, such as `BitKeeperSCM` are quite tiny to deserve a separate web page for them. The only way about this would be to check for the lengths of every choice, and then assign them hyperlinks if they are longer than a given threshold. The problem with this approach would be that the of all the choices would look pretty weird, because some will have expandable sub lists (so plus sign next to them), while some will be hyperlinks. 
23/03/2022, 19:38:38 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Is it better to ignore the fact that even some smaller choices have a separate web page for them?
23/03/2022, 19:41:28 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Moreover, for some steps like `properties`, most of the choices (although large in number) when expanded, are very small.
23/03/2022, 19:42:59 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): More the hyperlinks, more will be the number of Asciidocs that we'll have to generate...
24/03/2022, 04:40:29 - Kris Stern: Hi all, just a friendly reminder the Jenkins GSoC office hour this week is at March 24, 2022 @ 2PM UTC [EMEA]. For the Zoom link please checkout https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit?usp=sharing. 
24/03/2022, 05:54:35 - justcrossheaven (justcrossheaven): Hi teams! Below are some potential enhancements for the plugin management tool based on current existing issues. These are not represented in detail but just want to double check with you guys. Please make any comments on these points.  
Support for Java 17
Support json format input file: Most package manager (yarn, npm, nix etc.) would support the json file input and output and it might be easy to integrate this with other tools.
Add support for generating a new plugin file based on current Jenkins folder: https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/227
Support Maven pom with dependencies as input to the tool: https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/201
Split CLI to subcommands (and migrate to picocli): https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/237
Documentation update: There are still some TODOs in the code right now and some essential/core classes are not documented well enough.
Many Thanks!

25/03/2022, 18:56:25 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): @jmmeessen:matrix.org Thank you very much for your thought about  my Jenkinsfile Runner Action for GitHub Actions project propsal. Some description sentences are really annoying but I really didn't mean to say itüòî. I'll try my best to rephrase my words in the future. Furthermore, I add my comments/understandings about the questions you proposed and you can check them in your free time~

26/03/2022, 13:04:13 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): @koushartasneem I saw that you left a comment, but I don't know why it is showing that these comments are deleted. I hope I did not delete them accidentally :/

26/03/2022, 13:11:26 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I think you added the comments in the same thread as a test comment by me, which I deleted, and the whole thing got deleted along with it.

28/03/2022, 09:54:26 - Jmm: 
I want to clarify a little housekeeping detail: as a GSoC Org Admin, I will not accept bi-lateral conversation (aka direct chats). This is not because I want to ignore you (to the contrary). But this is because, as a Community, we work publicly as a principle and we don't want give an advantage to any individual candidate. We want all candidates to get the same information.
28/03/2022, 09:55:12 - Jmm: I understand that this is very uncomfortable and unusual to many. But it is an important aspect of working with Open Source.
28/03/2022, 09:55:49 - Jmm: I recommend mentors to have the same attitude until the selection process is completed.
28/03/2022, 09:56:53 - Jmm: I will be more than happy to engage individually and hear personal experiences once, at least, the selection process is completed.
28/03/2022, 10:00:38 - Jmm: For private matters, such as communication difficulties with mentors, GSoC contributors, or Org Admins, please send a mail to gsoc-jenkins-org-admin@googlegroups.com. All Org Admins will be notified.
28/03/2022, 10:21:43 - halkeye: Jmm: if you want to make a forum post I'll pin it to the top. Also whole heartily agree. DMs are bottle necks and points of failure.knowledge should be open and group effort especially in open source

2.) I've referred to the CONTRIBUTING.md file of the repo (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site/) to install pkgs and start dev server.

3.) I'm getting this error when I execute the command: "yarn dev", and search for a plugin at URL: http://localhost:3000/ui/search?query=http

```

29/03/2022, 06:18:13 - Dheeraj: Thank you Kris for your time, much appreciated. I tried running "gatsby develop" to create a production build (as suggested in "yarn dev"'s output) and then ran "yarn dev" cmd again, then tried to search a plugin, same error again.

The error says my certificate is not accepted, due to its altname being different than the expected 'DNS:d.sni.fastly.net' altname. Not sure about what to do here.
29/03/2022, 06:36:17 - Kris Stern: Screenshot 2022-03-29 at 12.35.32 PM.png (Media omitted)
29/03/2022, 06:36:49 - Kris Stern: I got it working after running `yarn install` and then `yarn dev` in ./plugins/plugin-site
29/03/2022, 06:37:37 - Kris Stern: You don't have to run `gatsby develop` unless you want the production build...
29/03/2022, 06:39:35 - Kris Stern: Wait, I see your error now
29/03/2022, 06:40:12 - Kris Stern: It says `Error when trying to proxy request "/api/plugins?page=&q=&sort=" to

29/03/2022, 06:41:03 - Kris Stern: halkeye: Do you know if this is expected or a bug? 
29/03/2022, 06:41:56 - Kris Stern: I have a feeling it has to do with some configuration issue...
29/03/2022, 06:42:37 - halkeye: not expected. When do you get that error? when you start it up? or when you do something on site?
29/03/2022, 06:43:42 - Kris Stern: I got the error after started it up
29/03/2022, 06:43:54 - Kris Stern: When I was interacting with the interface
29/03/2022, 06:47:03 - halkeye: oh okay, there's only 3 places hitting /api/plugins.

1) Search if you don't have an algola id set. We should just default to production values. Feel free to create a bug or PR for it. Neither key is secret, so feel free to use them, 

export GATSBY_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=HF9WKP9QU1
export GATSBY_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY=4ef9c8513249915cc20e3b32c450abcb

2) Releases tab. It won't break anything, but won't populate release notes
3) Issues tag. Totally broken, on my todo list to switch over to the new system, i just havn't gotten to it
29/03/2022, 06:49:13 - Kris Stern: Thanks, let me try
29/03/2022, 06:51:33 - Kris Stern: Works now
29/03/2022, 06:52:55 - halkeye: we can probably remove that fallthrough too, we left it in like a year+ ago when we tried out algolia, we won't be going back to the old system now
29/03/2022, 06:54:22 - Kris Stern: I see
29/03/2022, 07:13:27 - Kris Stern: By fallthrough I take it that you meant this?: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site/commit/81b5f890edf2d4cacb336c80964cc778a46d18cd
29/03/2022, 07:13:49 - halkeye: no i mean https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site/blob/master/plugins/plugin-site/src/templates/search.jsx#L40
29/03/2022, 07:17:19 - Kris Stern: Thanks for the correction... Let me open an issue for this `yarn dev` thing soon
29/03/2022, 07:37:46 - Dheeraj: oh nice, the first point helped in solving that issue, now I can search the plugins. Thanks to both of you!
29/03/2022, 08:11:19 - Dheeraj: I'm not able to see the fetched content for "Documentation" tab:
29/03/2022, 08:12:55 - Dheeraj: [![errorJenkins.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/sz7N/thumb/errorJenkins.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/sz7N/errorJenkins.png)
29/03/2022, 08:19:42 - Dheeraj: I exported the variables before yarn dev,
Then when I clicked on the "Releases" tab, I get the same kind of error:

```
 ERROR

  RequestError: Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames: Host: localhost. is not in the cert's altnames: DNS:d.sni.fastly.net
```
29/03/2022, 08:42:48 - Kris Stern: Yeah, I see only the Releases and Dependencies tabs being populated at the moment. 
29/03/2022, 08:45:32 - Kris Stern: According to Gavin:

> 1. Releases tab. It won't break anything, but won't populate release notes

So maybe that's not supposed to work currently, but it did work in my case.
29/03/2022, 08:48:23 - Dheeraj: Oh, I read that but didn't re-read it after observing the error. Thanks for pointing it out.

The releases tab is getting populated, but not will all of the data as seen on the plugin site.
For example, compare what you see here: https://plugins.jenkins.io/http_request/#releases and on the same page locally.
29/03/2022, 08:50:08 - Kris Stern: That's better than not being populated at all like the Documentation tab or the Issues tab
29/03/2022, 08:51:16 - Dheeraj: True
29/03/2022, 09:42:24 - halkeye: I said not populated with release notes. Release notes come from a service. Releases come from data
29/03/2022, 10:26:09 - Dheeraj: > I said not populated with release notes. Release notes come from a service. Releases come from data

Thanks for clarifying

29/03/2022, 13:27:36 - Kris Stern: Thanks Gavin for the help!

29/03/2022, 19:57:54 - harshlancer (Harsh Ranjan Dwivedi): Hello everyone my name is Harsh Ranjan Dwivedi and I want to contribute to Jenkin's project called "Automatic git cache maintenance on the controller" because it matches my tech stack. I'd be great if someone can guide me towards making my first contribution.Thank-You so much.
29/03/2022, 20:25:12 - Jmm: Hello harshlancer (Harsh Ranjan Dwivedi) 
Welcome aboard.
I guess that you already read the various jenkins GSoC documentation on https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ if you landed here
29/03/2022, 20:26:05 - Jmm: As a starter I would recommend listening to the recording of the GSoC Office Hours
29/03/2022, 20:26:51 - Jmm: They are referenced in this document
29/03/2022, 20:27:38 - Jmm: The other tip is to scroll through the history of this channel as well as the community.jenkins.io forum.
29/03/2022, 20:28:14 - harshlancer (Harsh Ranjan Dwivedi): Okay I'll definitely check it out
29/03/2022, 20:29:09 - Jmm: Last, there has been a one hour workshop on the Git subject. Look around for the references for the notes. The recording should be made available soon
29/03/2022, 20:32:50 - Jmm: Depending on you knowledge of Jenkins it is wise to have your own instance running and experiment with it (particularly with the Git system as this is your subject of interest).
Another good idea is to find some simple issues to solve so that you learn how the Community works.
29/03/2022, 20:35:20 - Jmm: Lastly, don't hesitate to join the Office Hour (we have one with a Pacific friendly time and one that is China/India/Europe/Africa friendly)
29/03/2022, 20:35:47 - Jmm: You will be able to ask any question you would still have.
29/03/2022, 20:43:37 - Jmm: Found the brainstorm notes, harshlancer (Harsh Ranjan Dwivedi) : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpeIX75i5ylM068JsMdhB8npuS7EEkIANdCmpLN_Yzo/edit?usp=sharing

30/03/2022, 08:55:15 - harshlancer (Harsh Ranjan Dwivedi): Okay so I've watched almost all of the videos should I start to solve issues? And thank-you so much for putting so much time to guide me.
30/03/2022, 10:02:40 - Kris Stern: <@harshlancer-623c03206da037398493052d:gitter.im "Okay so I've watched almost all ..."> Hi harshlancer (Harsh Ranjan Dwivedi) You definitely should, especially since the official application period will start really soon in early April. It would be recommended to have one PR submitted for a Jenkins-related issue, in particular ones related to the proposal you will be writing on. You can then reference your PR in your application in support of your case. 
30/03/2022, 10:04:55 - Kris Stern: Once you have drafted a proposal based on the project idea using the template we have provided, you can then submit it to Discourse for us to proofread as a Google doc (and remember to allow commenting by others). For more info please review the details here: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/#application-steps
30/03/2022, 16:14:59 - Jmm: Friendly reminder: In 24 hours we will hold the brainstorm about the "Plugin Health Score" project.

As announced, we will hold a one hour brainstorm session on Thursday March 31 at 14:00 UTC (10pm CST (China), 7:30pm IST (India), 16:00 CEST (Europe), 10am Eastern (US), 08am Mountain (US))

Use all the ressources that the Community offers you: so don't hesitate to reach out on other channels than the GSoC channel. Using other channels on community.jenkins.io are also a good idea.

Jenkins admins and mentors also conduct weekly online meetings for us, and you can find the MOMs of previous meets and the schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit). You can attend these to get more clarity about an idea you like, or about GSoC proposal guidelines. 
04/04/2022, 22:13:02 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Hi Arpit@ArpitKRS, welcome! You can check the idea list here https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/. The information provided by Vihaan is very helpful and you can also check it.
05/04/2022, 01:39:16 - alyssat (Alyssat): Hi Everyone. Given the GSoC contributor application period is April 4 - 19, 2022.  We are shooting to complete review for the  proposal drafts by Thursday, April 7 @  5PM UTC.  We've received proposals from: @Hrushi20,  @Cr1t-GYM, @aaryan-gautam, @vihaanthora, @RoyIL, @dheerajodha .  If anything changes we will provide update here.
05/04/2022, 06:46:45 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Hello, is anyone able to open the registration link on the GSoC website? Even the login link seems to be buggy (it is flooding the console with error messages).
05/04/2022, 07:21:25 - alyssat (Alyssat): A quick update to April 7 review mentioned above. Our mentors are requesting additional time for review. The new date is April 9. So expect mentors to be reviewing draft proposals until April 9.
05/04/2022, 08:34:26 - ArpitKRS (Arpit Kumar Singh): thank you for your help, also can you please tell me where to send proposals to and do you have any demo examples of proposals so that i can have an idea about how to write mine
05/04/2022, 08:37:17 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @vihaanthora I filled the registration form and submitted. I received the acknowledgment regarding the registration form submission. However after registration, the website still display that I have not registered. The website is buggy indeed.
05/04/2022, 08:41:21 - ArpitKRS (Arpit Kumar Singh): can someone paste the registration link here
05/04/2022, 08:41:36 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): You need to upload your draft proposal on https://community.jenkins.io/ . The mentors will then review your draft proposal and suggest any changes. This is the format of the proposal suggested by jenkins. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIlPLXfLbFsvcaHFuwmH9_lSCVm9m6-SgNYTNAnSZpY/mobilebasic

Once the submitted on the GSoC site it is considered as final (no review possible). Note that, AFAIK, it is possible to submit a new version until April 19.

05/04/2022, 17:06:13 - Jmm: Hey! Welcome Ayushagr145 (Ayush Agrawal) 
This project was discussed several times in the GSoC Office hours. Look at the notes (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit#heading=h.l6g1l7npq9c6) to spot the session of interest. The recording link is referenced in the notes.

05/04/2022, 19:15:28 - Ayushagr145 (Ayush Agrawal): Thank you so much and definitely for sure I will be going through it...
06/04/2022, 20:57:46 - ArpitKRS (Arpit Kumar Singh): Hey everyone, Arpit here, I've recently learnt a bit about git, docker, CI/CD pipelines and kubernetes. I took my interest in "Jenkinsfile Runner Action for GitHub Actions" project but I don't know much about it. All these technical terms are confusing me. This is my first project and I really wanna contribute in it. Can anyone please suggest me some resources or blogs that will help me understand it more clearly. I'm having issues while writing the project description in my proposal as I don't want to write something that I don't know about this project. Please help me gain some knowledge regarding this project and DevOps.

Kris Stern, mentor for that project, probably has also recommendations to get to speed.
06/04/2022, 21:18:26 - alyssat (Alyssat): @ArpitKRS You probably have already read through the project idea page https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/jenkinsfile-runner-action-for-github-actions/.  At the below office hours, Kris did a walk thru of the project idea as well. Check out the recordings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuLk2Nvs5Gw  &  https://youtu.be/i7Y0FM1tms4   Additional office hours notes and recordings are at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit?usp=sharing if you're interested.

07/04/2022, 08:20:15 - ArpitKRS (Arpit Kumar Singh): No worries, I just want to learn and contribute. I will stay connected with you guys, in case I miss this project I will still try to work with you all in future.
07/04/2022, 08:40:58 - Jmm: That is a very good idea ArpitKRS (Arpit Kumar Singh) : it is a very good way to get some experience and put an academic  knowledge into practice.
And we are more than willing to coach and mentor you (outside of the strict rules of GSoC). I have a couple of ideas to support that.
In the meantime, as time is really really very short for a meaningful GSoC proposal, I encourage you to follow these channels and records: it is the best way to learn (and get ready for contributions and next editions of GSoC)
07/04/2022, 10:16:29 - ArpitKRS (Arpit Kumar Singh): Sure sir, thank you very much for your kind support

07/04/2022, 22:07:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): > Hello World! What is the difference between `hudson.plugins.git` and `jenkins.plugins.git` packages in the git-plugin repo? Which files needs to be placed in which directory? 

The hudson.plugins.git package contains the earliest implementations from the git plugin (before Hudson was renamed to Jenkins).  The jenkins.plugins.git and other jenkins package names came after the rename of Hudson to Jenkins.  Prefer the jenkins package location for new code unless there is a compelling reason.

We have received some feedback that there has been some issues submitting proposals with the Google Summer of Code portal, having to do with login issues. 
08/04/2022, 10:30:32 - Kris Stern: A way to resolve this is to open a ticket with Google via the contacts info here: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/helphttps://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/help
08/04/2022, 10:30:59 - Kris Stern: If you need assistance in this regard please do let us know, we will see how we could best assist you in making a submission.

08/04/2022, 11:41:56 - Aaryan Gautam: What are some good commands and options that can be helpful when setting up the debugger and debugging the git plugin?
I was going through some resources like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2935375/debugging-in-maven) and [this](https://wiki.jenkins.io/JENKINS/Debugging-native-Maven-jobs.html)
08/04/2022, 13:01:16 - Kris Stern: <@aaryan-gautam:matrix.org "What are some good commands and ..."> May I asked what have you tried and why such means did not work for you?
08/04/2022, 13:24:48 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I run the plugin from inside Netbeans 12.6.  I compile the plugin outside Netbeans to assure that tests run, then I am able to set breakpoints and hit those breakpoints using the Netbeans debugger.

08/04/2022, 16:37:30 - Kris Stern: I think the basic requirement for the best debugging experience is to use an IDE that comes with a debugger
08/04/2022, 17:02:38 - Jmm: Agreed with Mark and Kris experience. In certain cases, remote debugging can be useful. I have seen cases, in badly behaved plugins (not git-plugin üòâ) that tests didn't run correctly in the IDE but were successful with Maven. In these cases, it is interesting to be able to do remote debugging. But this is an edge case.
08/04/2022, 18:31:05 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Hi! Are we still using this entrypoint in the Runner class of Jenkinsfile Runner project? I can't find the actual execution point in the setup module.

These are the two main entry points
09/04/2022, 05:55:31 - Aaryan Gautam: I have added a vm option and given the port address as 8000 where I then use the jvm debugger to listen to that port. 

09/04/2022, 05:55:32 - Aaryan Gautam: image.png (Media omitted)
09/04/2022, 05:56:23 - Aaryan Gautam sent an image. (Media omitted)
09/04/2022, 05:58:11 - Aaryan Gautam: these are the settings that I am using to do so. However, although the debugger connects to the port after running the mvn goal, it still does not stop at the breakpoints. I have a print statement before the breakpoint that checks that the code does execute that part but it does not stop at the breakpoint
09/04/2022, 05:58:48 - Aaryan Gautam: I found this configuration [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14602540/how-to-debug-a-maven-goal-with-intellij-idea)
09/04/2022, 06:21:24 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Yes. But in Bootstrap.java main method only executes Bootstrap entrypoint not the Runner.java. So I doubt we still use Runner's entrypoint.
09/04/2022, 06:23:39 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Or do we have other branches use the Runner.java as entrypoint?
09/04/2022, 06:24:23 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Maybe I missed something.
09/04/2022, 10:35:47 - Dheeraj: Thanks for the suggestions, Kris!
What worked for me is I tried to log in via another browser (Firefox) and it worked.

09/04/2022, 10:51:17 - Kris Stern: Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Have you gone through this docs section regarding the `setup` module?: https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/blob/master/docs/developer/STRUCTURE.adoc

09/04/2022, 11:00:01 - Kris Stern: Have you checked the official docs to see if you have followed all the relevant steps?: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html

The Stack Overflow answer you have cited is dated from many years ago. I am not sure if that still applies if you follow it 100%.

10/04/2022, 16:14:22 - Jmm: > am interested in the automatic spec generator for jenkins rest api

Sounds wise. It is an interesting project.
10/04/2022, 16:17:53 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): yeah it's an interesting project i just watched one of your office meetings explaining the project
10/04/2022, 16:19:22 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): but does it require prior knowledge to jenkins?
10/04/2022, 16:24:27 - Jmm: Understanding of Jenkins (especially the Rest API) will help you to build a strong proposal and increase your chances to be selected. I recommend to experiment with for exemple start a local instance (with docker).
10/04/2022, 16:26:05 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): ok thanks but am also considering the deadline for the proposal, the experimenting won't it extend the time because i was planning to write my proposal today
10/04/2022, 16:27:27 - Jmm: üëçÔ∏è
10/04/2022, 16:29:54 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): so, sir according to what you are saying i should first experiment with jenkins by running a local container of it using docker and also have a good understanding of REST API before submitting my proposal.
10/04/2022, 16:33:57 - Jmm: The more you know and the better your proposal (impactful) the better your chances to be selected. There will be several proposal for the same project I fear.
10/04/2022, 16:36:21 - Jmm: Having experience with the Jenkins Community and how it works (understanding the submission process) are also plus points.
10/04/2022, 16:37:17 - Jmm: But don't worry, work on your proposal and make it the best you can: it is valuable experience.
10/04/2022, 16:38:05 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): Thank you very much i really appreciate your friendliness and quick response
10/04/2022, 16:38:46 - Jmm: If you're not selected this year, we will help you prepare for the next edition.
10/04/2022, 16:39:30 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): i believe i will be selected this year :)

> Following the GSoC contributor application deadline, organizations begin reviewing the proposals they received. During the review phase, organizations maintain an open dialogue with their applicants. This may involve clarifying questions in regards to the final proposals to ensure applicants and organizations have the same understanding of the proposal. It is important to note an applicant‚Äôs proposal can‚Äôt be altered after the final submission deadline, and mentor organizations should not attempt to do so during the review period.
>
> Organizations may also conduct further interviews to determine which applicants are most likely to be a good fit for the community and work required. Over the course of several weeks, each organization prioritizes its list of proposals, ranking them and then submitting their requests for slots to Google. Google will let each organization know how many slots it will fund, and based on ranked order those proposals will be automatically selected (if given 5 slots, those proposals ranked 1-5 will be selected).

11/04/2022, 13:18:05 - Jmm: Hello pushker001 (pushker001) , welcome aboard.
A good start is to listen to the recordings of the Jenkins GSoC Office Hours. Many questions were asked and answered during these session.
11/04/2022, 13:18:09 - Dheeraj: @ADI10HERO Thanks very much for sharing the plugin health score calculating algorithm with me. I have one doubt/observation that I wanted to share with you (and everyone else)

As per the algo, if we pass unbounded discrete values via a "tanh" function, it will definitely bring our discrete value to a [-1,1] range but we might not be able to preserve some useful info. For example, I've noticed that the tanh function gives the value as "1" for both the (example) inputs "150" as well as "38825". 

So, even though both the values have a huge difference between them, both of them result in a common value "1" when passed through the tanh function. I believe, ideally, we would need to treat both values differently while calculating the health score.
11/04/2022, 13:19:19 - Jmm: Also, pushker001 (pushker001) , two brainstorm sessions on this project were organised. The recordings are available on-line.
11/04/2022, 13:19:35 - Jmm: Let me know if you have difficulties finding them.

Just a friendly reminder that the official application deadline is April 19th, so be sure to have a proposal submitted by that time for your application to be considered by Jenkins and Google. Also, confidential information like the number of slots Jenkins will be applying for and to be granted by Google is private and will not be disclosed by us. All the best with your applications!

Nevertheless, I will put some more thought into this and update the same on the brain storming document, would that be fine?
12/04/2022, 17:33:55 - Dheeraj: As per the discussion on the "Plugin Health Score" project idea's brainstorming session, we'd like to have weight re-adjusted every 12 weeks for now.
But how often would we want to re-run the health-score-calculation algorithm for each plugin? Given that, plugin repos merge new PRs every 2-3 days (or week maybe), so we'd want to display the "updated" health score quite frequently (not only every 12 weeks).

I was thinking about re-running the algorithm on every merged PR within a plugin's repo. What are your thoughts/suggestions on this?
12/04/2022, 17:41:28 - kuro: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "As per the discussion on the "Pl..."> I agree that the updated scores (based on that quarter's weights) should be shown to the maintainers/contributors, even though every merge sounds good, can we easily capture the event that a "merge" happened? (A question to other mentors as well)
 
And how does a score update on every release sounds?
12/04/2022, 17:42:10 - Dheeraj: @adi10hero:matrix.org yes that would be very helpful :-)
But I've tried to experiment with scaling down the higher values relative to the maximum value among them. It brings down the score for a parameter, let's say "No. of Installations", to a range of 0 to 1, but it introduces a dependency between the score of this parameter among all the other plugins. Because now we're measuring the scores for this parameter relative to one plugin's installation count, which not be good for the long run...

12/04/2022, 18:18:11 - Dheeraj: I don't yet how this can be done, but something remotely similar is done by Tim Jacomb. He automated weekly changelogs creation. I don't know the exact detail and I might not be totally correct, but his script tracks every PR (on creation) that gets submitted to the jenkinsci repo and includes them in a draft changelog based on the PR labels.

If we can perform a similar behavior, every time a PR merge happens in any of the plugin repo, a script re-runs the algorithm to update the health score of that plugin. Then we might need to publish this new score every time to maintain consistency, which means on a busy day if there's lots of PR merge happening then we might come across the "readers-writers problem"...but maybe I'm going too far
12/04/2022, 18:23:06 - halkeye: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "I don't yet how this can be done..."> I think that's more effort than it's worth. Have it run once a day is probably more than enough. You can have webhooks for pull requests though so it's doable. You'll probably get large batches of PRS for dependabot so your system is going to need to be able to denounce anyways
12/04/2022, 20:01:26 - Dheeraj: I totally forgot about large batches of PRs from dependabot which we'd need to ignore anyways. Running the algo once a day and thereby updating the published scores every day sounds good. Thank you!

30/04/2022, 18:58:21 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hey! I'm facing problem when using the "Parameterized Scheduler" Plugin(https://plugins.jenkins.io/parameterized-scheduler). I thought to use this plugin as a reference for scheduling git maintenance Cron jobs. I cloned the repo and tried debugging it, but while creating a new FreeStyle job in the UI, I don't find the option `Build periodically with parameters.`.  Do I need to setup any initial configuration to view this option?
30/04/2022, 18:59:16 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thank You. I couldn't attend the meet due to college work. 
01/05/2022, 02:07:17 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I installed the parameterized scheduler plugin and I don't see the "Build periodically with parameters" checkbox on a Freestyle project either.  Exploring further to understand if that is a bug in the plugin, a bug in the documentation, or a bug in Jenkins core
01/05/2022, 02:19:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): More exploration shows that the checkbox is not visible until a parameter is defined for the job.  A parameter is defined for a Freestyle project by clicking "This project is parameterized" and then assigning a parameter to the job.  Once that is done, then the checkbox becomes available to schedule a job with that parameter value.

01/05/2022, 09:03:48 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thank You. The checkbox is now visible. Is this the default behaviour of the plugin?
01/05/2022, 13:43:35 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I believe it is the default and expected behavior of the plugin.  When a job is not parameterized, it does not make sense to offer to schedule it with parameter values.

It is your responsibility to determine if your visa allows you to participate in a program like GSoC, please check before applying. You should also be sure that you can accept the stipend so you are not surprised later if you can not (often due to visa concerns).

The learning strategy depends on where your interest lies and how comfortable you feel. A good start is to browse the various plugins and search for newbie-friendly issues. Best is to concentrate on plugins or functionalities that are important to you and you use regularly. 
Second advise is to start small to get familiar with the process (pull request, review, etc). A good start is some documentation update: they are very useful (and often forgotten). The risk of breaking something or not understanding the (sometimes overwhelming) machinery/framework is limited.
Clearly explain what you intended to do in your PR and request guidance or explanation to the maintainer or the fellow developers. Sometimes they have little time or assume pre-existent knowledge. Don't hesitate to ask if you have doubts. 
Last advise is to use the developer mailing list (jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com) to get development/contribution related support.

21/05/2022, 06:18:15 - AbhyudayaSharma (Abhyudaya Sharma): Congrats @dheerajodha @Cr1t-GYM @Hrushi20 @vihaanthora!
21/05/2022, 07:47:02 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thank You. I love the community support and looking forward to contributing to Jenkins :) 
21/05/2022, 09:11:18 - Dheeraj: Hey @AbhyudayaSharma o/
Thank you very much! Looking forward to the exciting summer with Jenkins :-)
21/05/2022, 09:33:47 - rishabhBudhouliya (Rishabh Budhouliya): Here's to a great summer experience coming ahead, congrats @Hrushi20 @dheerajodha @Cr1t-GYM @vihaanthora !
21/05/2022, 09:37:42 - Dheeraj: Hi @rishabhBudhouliya o/
Thank you very much :-)
21/05/2022, 16:39:02 - Kris Stern: Congrats, everyone! 
21/05/2022, 17:24:03 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): My heartfelt gratitude toward all the mentors and the community :)
Thanks a ton for everything!
21/05/2022, 18:30:56 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Thanks for the valuable advice from the community members! The mentors are very friendly and always give the responses quickly.
22/05/2022, 16:55:03 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Can I come up with a class diagram for my implementation of the Git Maintenance project? Will it be useful to get an overview of the implementation? 
22/05/2022, 17:48:47 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If it helps you in the thinking process or in the discussion with us, then you have my full support to do it.  I'm not especially skilled with the UML or object diagramming techniques, but am happy to use pictures to have a conversation about implementation
22/05/2022, 18:00:47 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also, I am not able to use my local git-client-plugin as a dependency in the git-plugin. I wanted to test the maintenance commands in the git-client-plugin using the git-plugin. I tried adding the `<scope>system</scope>` and added path to the git-client-plugin in POM.xml of the GitPlugin. However, while building the project, I get an error. Is this the right way to proceed?
22/05/2022, 18:04:52 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): You should be able to make a local change in the git client plugin and then depend on the incremental build that results from that local change.  See https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/incrementals/#ji-toolbar for the description.  You may need to submit a draft pull request to git client plugin with your changes if you want to share them with others (like us as mentors), but that should be enough.  Then you change the git client plugin dependency in the git plugin pom to be that incremental version.

I use incremental builds frequently in my interactive test environment based on https://github.com/MarkEWaite/docker-lfs/tree/lts-with-plugins
22/05/2022, 18:14:41 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Wow! That makes things easier. Thank You.

23/05/2022, 14:00:53 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): @Cr1t-GYM @krisstern:matrix.org Hi. Based on the conversation, I created the #gsoc-jenkinsfile-runner channel on the CDF Slack for the Jenkinsfile Runner GitHub Action project
23/05/2022, 14:01:06 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): And congrats to all accepted contributors and the mentoring teams!
23/05/2022, 15:54:38 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much @krisstern:matrix.org  and @oleg-nenashev  :-)
23/05/2022, 15:56:45 - Dheeraj: In order to have more focused conversations, should I create a separate channel for the Plugin Health Score project?
23/05/2022, 16:06:29 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Thanks! I just received the invitation.
23/05/2022, 16:12:09 - Jmm: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "In order to have more focused co..."> This is indeed useful. You can, as a team choose to create a Gitter channel or request the creation of a slack channel. Gitter should be straight forward. For Slack, I have no idea what gods need to be implored for that. Hints welcome.
23/05/2022, 16:12:54 - Jmm: Don't forget to update the project page with the information as soon as it is available.
23/05/2022, 16:23:52 - Dheeraj: Since both platforms are nice places to have discussions, I think I will then first discuss it with the team to find out where they're more comfortable interacting.
23/05/2022, 17:57:57 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Congrats everyone!

23/05/2022, 20:18:58 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Will we create separate channels for each project? I think it would be more convenient to have project-specific discussions as @dheerajodha mentioned. I personally find gitter to be quicker and easier to access, so would prefer to continue its use for the same. Any thoughts on this @mentors @tasneemkoushar @arpoch  @kwhetstone?
23/05/2022, 20:23:05 - Jmm: <@vihaanthora-61dfc3eb6da03739848e38e0:gitter.im "Will we create separate channels..."> Although I don't have the experience of previous years, I personally think that a separate channel per project is a good idea. But am interested to hear other's experience/wish/opinion.

24/05/2022, 19:08:14 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @MarkEWaite, Not able to join the meet regarding GSoC Git Cache Maintenance. It says `Please wait for the host to start the meeting.`. 
24/05/2022, 19:08:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): So sorry, @Hrushi20 .  Starting the meeting now.  Back to back meetings are not a good thing
24/05/2022, 20:26:15 - arpoch (Harshit Chopra): It would be a good idea, as it would make the chat be more specific 
24/05/2022, 20:33:57 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): We discussed in the GSoC launch meeting for the git cache maintenance project and decided that we'll use https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/git-plugin for conversations about the project. We'll use community.jenkins.io for longer term items (meeting notes, meeting recordings, etc.).  Blog posts will continue to www.jenkins.io blog
24/05/2022, 20:34:46 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): I like having a separate channel for the projects as it makes it easier to chat about project specifics
24/05/2022, 20:42:02 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): I don't think I have permission to create a channel (I've definitely looked at this before).  Jean-Marc or Mark, could either of you create a gitter channel for our project?
24/05/2022, 20:42:44 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): It would be tied to the https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator repo (and it would be useful to have this as a channel for that repo regardless)
24/05/2022, 20:45:53 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @kwhetstone why not just use the existing https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/docs channel?  Low volume channel with docs related topics and docs related conversations already happening there
24/05/2022, 20:46:19 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Not quite as low volume as https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/git-plugin , but still low volume
24/05/2022, 21:23:25 - alyssat (Alyssat): I attempted to setup a slack channel for each project groups in CDF. It says "Your organization‚Äôs settings prevent you from using Slack Connect to invite people outside of Continuous Delivery Foundation."  I wonder if only the folks within CDF could set this up
24/05/2022, 21:26:52 - alyssat (Alyssat): I'll check w/ CDF but I'm a +1 for a separate messaging channel for each projects 
24/05/2022, 21:27:37 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): @MarkEWaite that definitely works for me, how about you @vihaanthora ?
25/05/2022, 04:15:48 - Dheeraj: @alyssat while you're asking CDF, can you also please try for a separate slack channel for the Plugin Health Score project? If possible. Let me know if I can help, thanks!
25/05/2022, 04:47:55 - halkeye: couldn't you just make a new channel? or does cdf limit who can create channels?
25/05/2022, 05:02:39 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): @kwhetstone sure, I think we can start off with `jenkinsci/docs` channel, and if either the community or we feel that we should use a separate channel, we can do that in the future. 
25/05/2022, 05:05:59 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @MarkEWaite , do we need to use the same link as yesterday to join the meet regarding Git Cache Maintenance?

25/05/2022, 05:36:19 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): We should have used the same link, but I had forgotten to schedule the session and was out of the house helping a friend with a printer problem.  My sincere apologies!  
25/05/2022, 05:37:11 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Can we have the meet some other time this week?
25/05/2022, 05:52:31 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also @MarkEWaite can you upload yesterday session on community.jenkins.io so that I can refer to it.
25/05/2022, 05:53:42 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Will do the upload tomorrow.  Been a long day and I need sleep
25/05/2022, 08:42:32 - Dheeraj: I saw that Oleg set up the channel for the Jenkinsfile runner project, plus Alyssa mentioned that she is not able to create a channel so I thought this could only be done by a person having specific permissions from CDF's side. So I assumed I shouldn't be doing this.

But interestingly enough, I just tried to create a channel and it worked. 
Another reminder for me not to "assume" things beforehand üòÉ
25/05/2022, 11:16:46 - Dheeraj: I have created the #gsoc-plugin-health-score channel on the CDF slack, please feel free to join it, the more the merrier.

I'm not sure if I'd be able to invite people who aren't part of the CDF workspace, so maybe they'd need to first join the CDF workspace. Here's the link I found on their GitHub: https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-nwc0jjd0-G65oEpv5ynFfPD5oOX5Ogg
25/05/2022, 20:32:00 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): @kwhetstone do you think we should create a channel on slack and use it for our project as well?
25/05/2022, 20:34:07 - alyssat (Alyssat): Let me look into creating slack channel for each project via  CDF
26/05/2022, 01:05:46 - alyssat (Alyssat): I had Michelle in CDF create sub groups but she too was not able to invite people. She said you need to be a 'CDF member'.  She sent out invites  and hopfully once invites are accepted it will fix the issue
26/05/2022, 01:12:01 - alyssat (Alyssat): Sorry I didn't see your msg earlier.  It looks like you were successful at creating the sub group : gsoc-plugin-health-score . I was going to ask you how you did that because both Michelle (CDF) and I were not successful at it
26/05/2022, 06:17:06 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Sorry that I missed the question.  Would Friday morning your time (8:00 AM or 8:30 AM ) work OK?
26/05/2022, 06:20:24 - Hrushikesh: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "Sorry that I missed the question..."> Friday 8:30 Am would do.
26/05/2022, 15:36:46 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Only if you think you'd like it.  I feel like we get a lot of interaction with the broader Jenkins community here on gitter and in https://community.jenkins.io/  
26/05/2022, 15:37:04 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): In previous summers, we've used gitter, and it's worked pretty well
26/05/2022, 15:39:27 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): I really want to work with people interested in docs and keep the cool work  you're doing as visible as possible :)  Especially as layout can be something you want to get a lot of feedback about, getting some eyes on what you're building is a great idea
26/05/2022, 16:11:35 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I agree, +1 for gitter
26/05/2022, 16:32:09 - Jmm: I have also a tendency to prefer Gitter mainly because it is easy for Community to participate (no need to register/get invited, no need to install a software in its simple form, using Element allows to consolidate several channels at one place).
But it is like colours or preferred editor: it is a personal choice.
26/05/2022, 16:32:38 - Jmm: each team should find a compromise and choose what works best for them
26/05/2022, 16:33:20 - Jmm: this is a discussion item for the GSoC 2022 Kick Off meeting that starts in 30 minutes.
26/05/2022, 17:46:06 - Dheeraj: Hi Alyssa, just wanted to share my answer in more detail here.

- I joined using this invite link: https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-nwc0jjd0-G65oEpv5ynFfPD5oOX5Ogg
- Clicked on "Add channels" > "Create a new channel", then named it and hit "Create"

As I read your previous message, you've mentioned that you're having problems inviting people and it complains when we send invites to people who aren't part of the CDF Slack.

It was easier in my case because all my mentors were already a member of CDF Slack so I just had to click on "Add people" and search for their names and hit add. So, if you ask the interested people to first join CDF Slack with the link above, then you'd be able to easily add them by clicking on the "Add people" option inside your channel. I hope this helps.
26/05/2022, 19:02:53 - alyssat (Alyssat): thank you @dheerajodha
26/05/2022, 19:06:53 - alyssat (Alyssat): the recording and notes to today's GSoC kickoff is at https://community.jenkins.io/t/gsoc-2022-kickoff-meeting-may-26-2022/2556  I also updated the slide deck with links to project source codes (slide 11) and email addresses on slide 12.

28/05/2022, 14:31:40 - Jagruti joined the room
31/05/2022, 15:51:15 - Dheeraj: As per the discussion I had with my project mentors, we have mutually decided to use a new Gitter channel for the "Plugin Health Score" project.

The reason to switch here is, that even though Slack provides tons of nice features to have async conversations, it's a little difficult for people to join the channel there, especially for people who just want to have a look at how things are going on. It feels like the slack channel lives on an island, and the gitter channel, on the other side, is open and easy to use (something which Jean already mentioned)

Having said that, can anyone with relevant permissions please create a new channel? Because I tried creating by clicking on  "Create room" on the left sidebar and it is not showing me the option of "jenkinsci" under the "Select Community" dropdown.
31/05/2022, 15:53:29 - Jmm: Will chase this dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) and find out who and how it can be done (Mark is traveling currently)
31/05/2022, 15:55:52 - Dheeraj: Sure, there's no rush (we have Slack in the meantime). Thanks for the help
31/05/2022, 16:06:22 - Jmm: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha): does "https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/GSoC-Plugin_Health_Score" work for you. I was able to create it
31/05/2022, 16:12:30 - Dheeraj: Works perfectly and just joined it, thank you

17/06/2022, 13:52:19 - vaibhav_2105: Hi all. I am a student of IIIT Lucknow. I am very new to open source but am familiar with the basics of networking, docker, Kubernetes, and Linux commands. Is there any way that I can contribute to Jenkins and get hands-on experience in a real DevOps project?  As a matter of fact, I am aiming for GSOC 2023.                                                                                                           My email id: jakkulavaibhav@gmail.com
17/06/2022, 13:54:38 - Jmm: Welcome vaibhav_2105 
I can only encourage you to follow that path to learn and contribute back.
17/06/2022, 13:57:11 - Jmm: Leave me some time to answer you with a structured advice. For GSoC in particular, have a close look on the documentation related to GSoC 2022 at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/
17/06/2022, 13:59:29 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @vaibhav_2105:matrix.org  yes, there are many ways to contribute to the Jenkins project.  If you're interested in Kubernetes, then you could contribute by reviewing https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/ as a new user.  Perform the steps in that documentation as a new user.  Identify steps that can be described more clearly or in more detail.  Submit a pull request (through the "Improve this page" link at the bottom of the page).

If you're interested in Docker, then you could contribute by reviewing the Docker based tutorials as a new user.  When you find that the description is incorrect, incomplete, or unclear, submit a pull request through the "Improve this page" link at the bottom of the page.

18/06/2022, 18:12:58 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I would guess that there is a DNS resolution problem in your Kubernetes cluster.  It is reporting that charts.jenkins.io is not a known host.

20/06/2022, 17:28:19 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Thanks! It works now. I tried to use Apache id with 3.6.3 to download the maven but it cannot work and I don't know the reason. I referred the official demo in https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/tree/master/demos/maven. Is it a bug or do I need to add more configurations for that?

My previous usage:
```Yaml
tool:
  maven:
    installations:
      - name: maven3
        home: "/maven3"
        properties:
          - installSource:
              installers:
                - maven:
                    id: "3.6.3"
```
20/06/2022, 19:28:49 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): In any case, you don't want to use Apache Maven 3.6.3 for anything.  Use at least Apache maven 3.8.5, and preferably 3.8.6.  However, I haven't checked to see if that tool definition is sufficient to download Apache Maven from their servers

21/06/2022, 16:43:32 - Jmm: <@vaibhav_2105:matrix.org "Yeah, sure.Thank you :)"> Hello,
I hope you have been able to progress with your helm experiments

Mark's advice was very good.

I would add that the learning strategy depends on where your interest lies and how comfortable you feel. A good start is to browse the various plugins and search for newbie-friendly issues. Best is to concentrate on plugins or functionalities that are important to you and you use regularly.

Second advise is to start small to get familiar with the process (pull request, review, etc). A good start is some documentation update: they are very useful (and often forgotten). The risk of breaking something or not understanding the (sometimes overwhelming) machinery/framework is limited.

Clearly explain what you intended to do in your PR and request guidance or explanation to the maintainer or the fellow developers. Sometimes they have little time or assume pre-existent knowledge. Don't hesitate to ask if you have doubts.
Last advise is to use the developer mailing list (jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com) to get development/contribution related support.

Also stay tuned: from the end of August on, we will probably organise online meetings to give hints/advise and answer questions from those who would like to prepare actively for GSOC 2023.

I have gone through the document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit?usp=sharing

 and I need a little bit of clearance as I checked some plugins that already have some contributors, so my basic question is whether the general steps for modernizing a plugin can be done in those plugins as well, or do I have to go for a plugin having no contributor? 
18/08/2022, 21:46:16 - halkeye: <@iqbalrohail-60b7cc596da03739847dff1a:gitter.im "Hello, community, "> A plugin with no active contributors, you'd have to either take over, or hope someone eventually sees your PR.
A plugin with active contributors. I would let them know first (open an issue or draft pr or something) just incase they've already started.

I guess it depends on what you are referreing to when you say "has some contributors"
18/08/2022, 22:06:25 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): my point is supposed there is a plugin having other contributors, so they have already gone through the general steps for modernizing that plugin as I am a new contributor I am learning now and these steps are the possible way I could start my contributions. 
18/08/2022, 23:29:31 - halkeye: https://reports.jenkins.io/jenkins-plugin-migration.html any of the ones that are labeled TODO probably don't have anyone touching them.

MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): probably knows better ones to look into
18/08/2022, 23:44:19 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i would be checking them , thanks :)
19/08/2022, 12:24:12 - Dheeraj: As mentioned above, if you have a particular plugin repo you're referring to, then feel free to share its link here for more context.

As per my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong), some plugins might have been "modernized" to some extent by some previous contributor who followed just the first 5 tasks (say) of the document you linked above. In that case, you can either complete the remaining tasks from the document for that plugin or if you want to start fresh from Task 1, then pick a new plugin from the link shared by Gavin in the following message, and try to "modernize" it from the start.

But it wouldn't be wise to open a PR on the same task someone else already has an open PR for, without notifying them (as mentioned in the above message).
19/08/2022, 23:07:10 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hello Dheeraj , yes you got me correct.  so yes I got your point and I was also thinking the same. Thanks for the clarification and help :)

12/09/2022, 15:47:23 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hello World, I received the link to submit my gsoc final submission. There is a field which asks me to `provide a link to the work I have done`.  Is this regarding the blog which I need to submit? The  requirements for submission link is provided [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/work-product#requirements). Not sure what I need to do. 
12/09/2022, 15:48:48 - Jmm: It is to the artifact or artifact group you delivered. Maybe discuss it with your mentor what is best put there
12/09/2022, 16:33:19 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Hi Hrushikesh, I linked my project page in that field.
12/09/2022, 16:38:37 - Dheeraj: and I linked my project repo's URL in this field.
The project repo's README.md file would contain the final deployment URL once the deployment work gets completed later.
12/09/2022, 16:56:31 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): As I have many repos at the end, I used my original project page URL for submission. In the original project page, I indexed all the repos URLs and other necessary content for evaluation such as blog post.
12/09/2022, 16:57:46 - Jmm: I thought a little about that: I think that a link to the jenkins.io project page (with all the links, documentation. repos) is OK for this
12/09/2022, 16:58:38 - Jmm: I prefer to keep the blog post for when we do the JOM.
The Project Page can be updated during the coming days even after submitting the review
12/09/2022, 16:58:43 - Jmm: WDYT?

25/09/2022, 11:13:04 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hello, community,
where can we find plugin documentation explaining the workflow of each plugin?  
25/09/2022, 12:52:02 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Strongest preference is that each plugin includes its  documentation inside its own GitHub repository.  That documentation is then shown to users and search engines through https://plugins.jenkins.io/ .  The documentation is usually in the README file.  See https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin#readme for an example of plugin documentation.

Plugins that provide Pipeline tasks include online help inside the plugin.  That online help is available inside the Jenkins controller through the Pipeline snippet syntax generator and is also automatically extracted to be read at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/
25/09/2022, 20:17:37 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Thankyou 
27/09/2022, 20:16:57 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hey everyone, 
how do we get to know which classes are responsible to run the Jenkins plugin controller?
27/09/2022, 21:54:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Can you provide more detail in your question and more detail about the conditions that caused you to ask the question?

If you are asking, "How can I find the classLoader that loaded the classes of my plugin?" that is a different question than "How do I find the classes that implement the Jenkins plugin manager and its dependency resolution?" and is a different question than "How do I find the classes that are part of the Jenkins controller?"

 I am Dhraj Sardar. I am  interested in jenkin project (Automatic git cache maintenance on the controller ). Can someone help me out  how can i do contribution . I am newbie  and learning the new technologies like git, linux ,java and so on from few months.
30/09/2022, 18:45:04 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @DhirajSardar that specific Google Summer of Code project has finished. It needs more testing and some UI improvements, but those tasks are probably not well suited to a first time contributor.

You may want to spend some time learning more about Jenkins, then you can decide which parts of Jenkins are interesting to you.

Some tutorials to introduce you to Jenkins
* Java and Maven - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven
* NodeJS and React - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm
* Python - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-python-app-with-pyinstaller
* Multibranch Pipeline - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-multibranch-pipeline-project/

If you're ready to jump immediately into coding, you could review the five part video series "Modernizing a plugin".  It begins with

02/10/2022, 04:51:59 - Dani-Google (Dani): Hi @MarkEWaite 

I'm a first-year Software engineering student. 

There is still a week before my first semester starts.I have already learned Linux, Python basics,Html, CSS, Docker, and Git on my own as I want to become a DevOps engineer in future and on path of self-learning and exploring
 I can blog and design occasionally as well but my main aim is DevOps and that's how I discovered Jenkins for building, testing and deploying apps.

 I loved Jenkins from the very first moment as its user friendly other than its catchy name, cool logo as it gives very cool fresh vibe :)

I'm no expert but a student, learning, and exploring every day. I love the idea of Open source  and would like to contribute in Jenkins as per my skill set. 

Please recommend me some beginner friendly tasks and details, so I can 
contribute n become a part of JENKINS :)
02/10/2022, 05:55:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): See the suggestions at https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#where-to-contribute for good starter ideas.  See earlier responses in this channel for good places to learn more about Jenkins.  As you learn more, you'll likely find areas that interest you and areas that are less interesting.  As you discover your own interests, you'll find ways to contribute to Jenkins that also address your interests.
02/10/2022, 06:23:11 - halkeye: Never hurts to help triage bug reports,  or Code reviews. New people have a different perspective and itsa great way to learn

06/10/2022, 19:29:14 - dipanshu: 
Hello Jenkins Community, I am Dipanshu.

I am a new contributor. I read the blog on **Improve the plugin** and found it very helpful to get started. A big thanks to the writers to make it so easy to understand.

I did the research and found a plugin called [Test Result Analyzer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/test-results-analyzer/) which needs modernization. 

I could see there are no issues listed on the repository. 

**Should I just fork, make changes,  test and then make the PR, or Do I need something else before making the PR ?**

06/10/2022, 19:32:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Those are the right steps @_dipansh_twitter .  
06/10/2022, 19:35:19 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Steps that plugin needs include:
* Update parent pom
* Update Jenkins version
* Automate dependency updates
* Use plugin bill of materials
* Add a contributing guide
06/10/2022, 19:37:35 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @_dipansh_twitter each of those should be a separate pull request.  Some of them may require that you combine multiple steps to complete the single step.  If you encounter problems, ask questions here and we'll do our best to answer
06/10/2022, 23:08:23 - dipanshu: **Thanks @MarkEWaite for the overview**
06/10/2022, 23:08:41 - dipanshu: I made PR's for updating parent POM. [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/53).

I also resolved the **UpperBoundDeps error** while updating the Jenkins base version by implementing BOM. 

I tested the new build and it passed.

But i was wondering since i removed the **<java.level>** property ([refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/54)) and upgrade the POM version 

I don't have a deep understanding of git version control but **i fear it may create some merge conflicts**.

**Is it ok to make the PR for Jenkins base version upgrade or should I wait for the PR's to be merged so that i don't need to update the POM and delete the <java.level> property in every new branch**.
06/10/2022, 23:11:48 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Good question.  I approved and merged your pull request to update the parent pom.  The delete of java.level is now being evaluated by the CI job.  Will merge it once it passes CI
06/10/2022, 23:14:14 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): It is OK to make a PR for Jenkins base version upgrade without waiting for the predecessor PR to merge.  When you create the new branch for the new capability, first merge the predecessor branches into the new branch.  Then start the work on the new capability.  Hopefully I'll keep up with your pace proposing pull requests and you won't need to spend too much time doing that
06/10/2022, 23:28:30 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin pull request has merged @_dipansh_twitter 
06/10/2022, 23:31:48 - dipanshu: I never thought of doing it this way, It would be very efficient.

This is my first pull request to be merged into an open source project :).

07/10/2022, 00:28:11 - dipanshu: Some queries regarding the update of base Jenkins version

- Implemented the BOM to remove the **UpperBoundDeps error**
- In order to do I saw that it mentions that we could remove the version definition 
- It builds and passes every check without the version definition. Is it safe to remove that.


07/10/2022, 01:41:08 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, if the code still compiles with a version definition removed, then that version is being provided by either the parent pom or the BOM
07/10/2022, 07:43:11 - Dheeraj: That's amazing, congratulations!!
07/10/2022, 11:43:22 - dipanshu: While updating  scm URL [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/blob/master/pom.xml#L42) 

I found that it uses a SSH protocol not a plain git protocol.

I found a documentation regarding the **differences and trade-off between SSH and HTTPS** [refer](https://gist.github.com/grawity/4392747)

**Overall I'm leaning towards using HTTPS over SSH as it is the one that github  recommends us to use**

Please Do let me know if I should leave as it is or change it to HTTPS ?
07/10/2022, 11:58:16 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There are two URL's in the SCM configuration.  One is for general purpose access (read only) and the other is for developer access (read and write).  The general purpose access should be https because it does not require any private key to be registered with GitHub.  The developer access can be either SSH or https because read/write can be done with either protocol.
07/10/2022, 12:01:49 - dipanshu: okay got it, I'll change it HTTPS
the PR for base Jenkins version update is build and verified [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/55)

07/10/2022, 12:07:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Merged.  Thanks very much.  I hope you're willing to continue on that plugin, since there are several more modernization steps that would help it.  I'd especially like to have the documentation migrated from the Wiki to the GitHub repository, then we could create a new release of the plugin with updated documentation.
07/10/2022, 12:23:15 - dipanshu: I'd would love contribute and help.

Will be working on documentation soon

Since, I am very new to open source and Jenkins I might need help to understand the concepts and workflow better 

The [PR](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/56) for https protocol change is build and verified
07/10/2022, 12:30:32 - dipanshu: Thanks @dheerajodha 
You really helped me a lot to get started.

07/10/2022, 14:45:53 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Vandit1604 see the suggestions at https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#where-to-contribute for good starter ideas.  See earlier responses in this channel for good places to learn more about Jenkins.  As you learn more, you'll likely find areas that interest you and areas that are less interesting.  As you discover your own interests, you'll find ways to contribute to Jenkins that also address your interests.

07/10/2022, 15:44:11 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @_dipansh_twitter I'd like to release a new version of the plugin with your changes particularly for documentation.  That won't prevent you from submitting more pull requests and it makes the GitHub based documentation available sooner.  Any objections from you?
07/10/2022, 16:16:45 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): @MarkEWaite i found some minor fix and it would be great to start with this can you help me about how to setup the files as im unable to run the jenkins site as host. this is the issue im intrested in https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-69787?jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)%20AND%20labels%20in%20(newbie-friendly)%20AND%20component%20in%20(core)

Yeah, sure it would be perfect.
I'll continue to modernize the other aspects of the plugin

07/10/2022, 19:59:11 - Dheeraj: Which zip file are you trying to extract? Can you give more context on what you're trying to do?
As per the error, maybe there's already an existing folder named similar to the one that you are trying to unzip now.
07/10/2022, 21:03:17 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): i downloaded this and opened it not in program files x86 now when i tried extracting it this error pops up that's in the image

07/10/2022, 21:14:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): It is usually much less complicated if you create a tools directory in your user directory and put all your tools there.  Maven does not need to be installed into the Windows system directories.
07/10/2022, 21:15:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): In my case, I have `C:\Tools\apache-maven-3.8.6` but I could have also done `C:\Users\MarkE\tools\apache-maven-3.8.6`
08/10/2022, 08:17:40 - AayushSaini101 (Zack_Aayush): @MarkEWaite Sir, Can we add the view and like option on the cards of the jenkins plugins. Like https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/zack_aayush/articles on the article, and also we can add a feedback funnel on the plugin to track the issues in the efficient ways.
08/10/2022, 08:35:33 - halkeye: I don't think we want to store plugin issues in more places. We already have them in multiple places
08/10/2022, 09:17:03 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): @MarkEWaite i created a directory for tools and copied maven.zip there and changed my path to it in enviorment variables still its not working

08/10/2022, 09:32:58 - dipanshu: I was working on increasing the depth of spotbugs analysis. 

**I increased the Effort to Max and threshold to low**

While testing it gave an error which made the build to fail 

```
[ERROR] Low: Use of non-localized String.toUpperCase() or String.toLowerCase() At TestCaseResultData.java:[line 18]
```

**The fix is adding a Locale.ROOT as a argument in toLowerCase()** at [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/testresultsanalyzer/result/data/TestCaseResultData.java#L18)

```
-     String status = ((String) statusReturnValue).toLowerCase();
+    String status = ((String) statusReturnValue).toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
```

**But adding this restricts us to using only Latin letters **

Let me know what should I do.
08/10/2022, 09:48:01 - dipanshu: Locale.ENGLISH would presumably also be a safe choice.
08/10/2022, 09:55:13 - Ulli Hafner: I typically use the ENGLISH locale.
08/10/2022, 15:08:43 - AayushSaini101 (Zack_Aayush): Okay sir, what about the like feature 
08/10/2022, 15:15:24 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Can you explain how you would see a "like" feature being used?  The plugins site shows the number of installations of a plugin.  The plugin health scoring project is assembling a collection of measurements that will help further guide administrators as they decide if they should install a particular plugin.  The project description is at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/plugin-health-scoring-system/ and the report on the GSoC 2022 implementation of a portion of the project is at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/projects/plugin-health-scoring-system/

I'll continue to modernize other aspects 

Any suggestions for improvements that I can work on ??

08/10/2022, 23:16:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There are a number of other suggestions for improvements in the "Contributing to Open Source" workshop document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit?usp=sharing
08/10/2022, 23:17:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're ready to adopt the plugin, you could take that step as well.  Adoption instructions are at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/
08/10/2022, 23:18:42 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Beginning early next week, I won't be available to review pull requests.  I'm taking a 2+ week vacation and won't be available.
09/10/2022, 16:57:40 - dipanshu: Wishing you a great vacation, Have a wonderful time! @MarkEWaite

I'll look into the adopt-the-plugin documentation.

Made two PR's
- https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/60
- https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/61

I am working on CONTRUBUTING.md for the plugin.

I think most of the aspects of this plugin have been modernized.

So, should I work on some different plugin which needs to be modernized or stick to this one and improve it in more ways ?
09/10/2022, 19:48:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Your choice, but I'm confident there is much more to be done on any plugin, including that one.  The "Improve a Plugin" tutorial provides only the very first steps.
If you'd like to learn more about writing automated tests with JUnit, then https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/test-results-analyzer-plugin/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/coverage/ shows that over 60% of the Java statements in that plugin are not executed by the automated tests.  Adding more automated tests is an interesting learning experience to explore a plugin and improve skills writing and verifying test code.
09/10/2022, 19:51:17 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you'd rather work on a plugin that is much more visible, the lockable resources plugin is widely installed and up for adoption.  There are reviewers ready to look at modernization pull requests for the lockable resources plugin.  Other plugins that need modernization and have willing code reviewers include:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin 
https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-condition-plugin 
https://github.com/jenkinsci/parameterized-trigger-plugin 
https://github.com/jenkinsci/conditional-buildstep-plugin

09/10/2022, 22:07:17 - dipanshu: Thanks you @MarkEWaite for an elaborate overview.

I'd like to learn and add more automated tests Junit tests for the plugin. However, I have little prior working knowledge of Junit. 

**Any specific references to get started with Junit in reference to plugin ?**

I'll also explore the mentioned plugins in the meanwhile and look for some aspects to modernize.
10/10/2022, 15:42:20 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): My technique to learn about writing tests with JUnit has been to follow the steps that a Hacktoberfest contributor added to the contributing guide of the node label parameter plugin.  See https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-coverage for those steps
1. Generate the coverage report of the Java classes and methods that are not covered by automated tests `mvn clean -DskipTests verify` to compile without running tests, then `mvn -P enable-jacoco clean verify jacoco:report`
2. View the report in a web browser
3. Open one of the untested classes in an IDE (Visual Studio Code, Intellij, Apache Netbeans) and use the "Create tests" feature of the IDE
4. Insert test implementations into one of the stubs that was created by the IDE, submit a pull request with that single test so that code review happens quickly
10/10/2022, 15:51:37 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): You can read the pull requests from that Hacktoberfest contributor at:
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/pull/165
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/pull/166
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/pull/167

The discussion is in one of the gitter chat channels as well, in case that helps
11/10/2022, 18:49:11 - dipanshu: Thanks @MarkEWaite,  The references made it much easier to comprehend how the test is actually constructed.

However, I've only been working with Junit for a day and still have a lot to learn about unit testing.

As my first unit test, I tried to implement a test for [ResultStatus.getValue()](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/testresultsanalyzer/ResultStatus.java#L14)

**I think it is working as expected. Could I make the PR with this implementation ?**

While I was working on writing tests i found this [test](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/blob/master/src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/testresultsanalyzer/result/AnalyzerPageTest.java#L17) had @Ignore annotation and says it needs some fix.

I was wondering whether to take this specific test and attempt to debug and fix it or whether to continue developing new tests till I had more understanding about tests.

11/10/2022, 23:57:03 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I recommend developing new tests for simple methods before the more advanced step of diagnosing or adjusting tests that already exist.  Yes, you can submit a pull request with a small test.
I'm out of the office for the next 2.5 weeks, so may not be fast with feedback.  Will need to rely on others like Jean-Marc Meessen, Bruno Verachten, and @uhafner:matrix.org 
12/10/2022, 14:45:06 - dipanshu: I'll keep working on  implementing new tests.

I made a PR this with the above implementation [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/62).

Since @MarkEWaite is out of office, 
Could somebody else please make a review ?

24/10/2022, 13:01:35 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): any help are welcome
24/10/2022, 15:25:21 - Kris Stern: You may want to take a look at this for contributing to Jenkins as a newcomer: https://www.jenkins.io/participate/
24/10/2022, 15:28:14 - Kris Stern: Prakriti Mandal: If you are aiming to participate in GSoC 2023 you may want to take your time warming up to the community since the next application cycle will be early 2023. You can ask further questions for contributing here or at say #jenkinsci_jenkins:gitter.im or #jenkinsci_newcomer-contributors:gitter.im 
24/10/2022, 15:30:47 - Kris Stern: And there is still time left to contribute via Hactoberfest, on our dedicated webpage you can find links to suitable issues to work on: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/
25/10/2022, 20:44:40 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hello ,  
I am getting the error while building the plugin maybe due to maven version conflicts . can anyone guide me about my query 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74198682/sudo-mvn-version-and-mvn-version-shows-different-versions
25/10/2022, 20:47:51 - halkeye: iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): root (sudo) often has different PATH variables to prevent people accidently running something from an insecure location.
25/10/2022, 20:48:19 - halkeye: honestly, i don't see why you'd want to sudo maven at all
25/10/2022, 20:52:09 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): while doing sudo mvn clean verify it automatically downloads the dependencies but when I did that with simple mvn clean verify it doesn't doing the thing 
25/10/2022, 20:52:25 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i was thinking maybe thats the issue 
25/10/2022, 21:03:05 - halkeye: it should automatically download dependancies as non root too. Sudo should only be used to make system changes, should never be used for day to day stuff.
25/10/2022, 21:35:10 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): @halkeye:g4v.dev i will try doing that
25/10/2022, 21:40:40 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): is this plugin https://github.com/jenkinsci/http-request-plugin
bound with java 8 ??
25/10/2022, 21:45:50 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): [logfile.txt](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/Gnyo/logfile.txt)
25/10/2022, 21:46:24 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): @halkeye:g4v.dev  here is the logs file kindly have a look
25/10/2022, 23:10:56 - halkeye: iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): thats very weird indeed. You could delete all your downloaded stuff by doing `rm -rf $HOME/.m2/repository/jenkins*`. It may be a corrupted download or something.
26/10/2022, 09:38:11 - @prakriti___:matrix.org: <@krisstern:matrix.org "You may want to take a look at t..."> Ok Kris Stern I will be looking on it.
28/10/2022, 07:00:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Not sure what you mean when you say "bound with Java 8".  If you are asking if it supports Java 8, the answer is "yes".  If you are asking if it can only be compiled with Java 8, then the answer is "no, it can be compiled with Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17 as shown by https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/http-request-plugin/job/master/108/pipeline-graph/
28/10/2022, 14:41:29 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Thanks for the guidance :)
28/10/2022, 19:39:28 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hey hope so everyone is doing great,
I want to add a spotbug check in https://github.com/jenkinsci/http-request-plugin
<spotbugs.threshold>Low</spotbugs.threshold>

28/10/2022, 19:41:24 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/cn3R/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/cn3R/image.png)
28/10/2022, 19:42:59 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): It's showing some errors, how to overcome them, can anyone guide, please?
28/10/2022, 19:51:31 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @iqbalrohail See https://github.com/jenkins-docs/lockable-resources-plugin/pull/3/files for an example that shows two different techniques to silence spotbugs warnings.  One technique is to make a code change.  I do those when I feel very confident that I understand the change and can justify that change in a commit.  The other technique is to place the specific file name and warning ID in an exclusion file.  Both techniques provide the benefit that future submissions will detect new spotbugs warnings
28/10/2022, 21:13:59 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): mark i am trying to resolve some checks by code changes , can you tell how I can assign a serialVersionUID ?
28/10/2022, 21:14:33 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i think this will solve this spotbug error 
[ERROR] Low: jenkins.plugins.http_request.auth.CredentialNtlmAuthentication is Serializable; consider declaring a serialVersionUID [jenkins.plugins.http_request.auth.CredentialNtlmAuthentication] At CredentialNtlmAuthentication.java:[lines 25-67] SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONID
28/10/2022, 21:20:07 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11881621/understanding-of-findbugs-warning-about-serialversionuid-field
28/10/2022, 21:20:55 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I haven't found serialVersionUID to be very useful in the places where I've been warned about it, so I tend to exclude it from the spotbugs warnings rather than include it as a code change
28/10/2022, 21:31:15 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): thanks alot 
28/10/2022, 21:36:07 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): does setting this 1 a good practice ?
28/10/2022, 22:54:37 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i have added spotbugs-exclude file as well but it shows me same thing after adding 
28/10/2022, 22:57:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): That almost always means you made a mistake either by not including a reference to the excludes file in the pom.xml file or by not including the correct reference to the class name in the excludes file
28/10/2022, 23:01:13 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): how that file will executes , what I was thinking that  by 
    <spotbugs.excludeFilterFile>${project.basedir}/src/spotbugs/spotbugs-excludes.xml</spotbugs.excludeFilterFile>
 
28/10/2022, 23:02:30 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, https://github.com/jenkins-docs/lockable-resources-plugin/pull/3/files uses that form
28/10/2022, 23:03:39 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Be sure that you're declaring the fully qualified class name and be sure that you are not declaring a methodName for the serial version UID exclusion
28/10/2022, 23:03:46 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): yes i did the same
28/10/2022, 23:04:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I'll need to see the code in a pull request.  Guessing won't work as effectively as seeing what you're trying and then exploring it further
28/10/2022, 23:04:58 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i have not added method name , I thinks only class name with path is enough
28/10/2022, 23:09:09 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): https://github.com/jenkinsci/http-request-plugin/pull/117
28/10/2022, 23:09:38 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): thats the PR your , 
28/10/2022, 23:19:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I've pushed the changes.  Class, field and method names had mistakes in them.  The class, method, and field names need to exactly match those reported by the spotbugs output
28/10/2022, 23:39:06 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): thanks for the review and change mark , it runs fine now 
28/10/2022, 23:44:52 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): https://github.com/jenkinsci/http-request-plugin/pull/116

I am a working backend SDE in Java with 4 months of experience and knowledge of C++.
I am new to open source and would appreciate guidance to how can I join the community and  gain hands on experience with contributing to open source.
Please suggest me on how to get started and need to know beforehand.
Thank you!
29/10/2022, 17:41:11 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): @Subzer0570  there are many steps how to starts and where to contribute. The question is what are you looking for. Development, Testing Documentation. Project-administration ... ? Anyway we are still looking for more contributors in https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin. Maybe you are interested üòâ . In that case contrinute in the discussion chanel. note. It is better to start with some 'small' plugin, then with jenkins-core. note2: Of cores you need a github account.
29/10/2022, 17:44:37 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Hello Martin @mPokornyETM, I am looking for development, I would really appreciate if you can guide me in which chatroom to discuss and how to get started in development. Thanks!
29/10/2022, 18:05:14 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): @mPokornyETM
before contributing on that plugin, can you please tell me what things do I need to know and what part of the plugin I'll be needed to contirbute
29/10/2022, 19:22:05 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Looks in the room too newcomer-contributors
29/10/2022, 19:31:12 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Look in this room newcomer-contributors. But i don't find there so much things 
29/10/2022, 19:34:03 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Basically you need github account.  And in many plugin you will find issues marked as 'good first issue' like this https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22
30/10/2022, 04:05:18 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/ is a tutorial that includes a series of small development steps for a new contributor.
30/10/2022, 16:27:08 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Welcome to the community , you can have a look on this document 'Contributing to Open Source' 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit#
follow the steps  ,  watch the video tutorials .
trust me this will benefit a lot!

30/10/2022, 20:36:28 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There are two developer tutorials if you're interested.  One for creating a new plugin (less needed with 1800+ plugins already existing) and one for improving a plugin (lots of need to improve plugins that already exist)

03/11/2022, 04:45:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): See the suggestions at https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#where-to-contribute for good starter ideas.  See earlier responses in this channel for good places to learn more about Jenkins.  As you learn more, you'll likely find areas that interest you and areas that are less interesting.  As you discover your own interests, you'll find ways to contribute to Jenkins that also address your interests.
05/11/2022, 11:47:18 - Kris Stern: alyssat (Alyssat) Jmm MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) I am thinking maybe I should open a PR to update and expand the page at https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/gsoc/? Any ideas or suggestions of improvement from you guys?
05/11/2022, 11:50:37 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Good idea.  I think one update would be to add yourself @krisstern:matrix.org as an org admin and remove Oleg as a participant.

15/11/2022, 15:32:29 - Jmm: Welcome Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal) 

Google did not announce officially the new edition (but probability is very high).
A blog post about GSoC2023@Jenkins will be published shortly.

But it is a very good initiative to start preparing for it. Get to know the Jenkins Community, read the various documentations, and learn by submitting pull-request.

15/11/2022, 15:34:08 - Jmm: There you go, Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal) . You are better informed than me. Thanks for sharing the link
15/11/2022, 15:34:39 - Jmm: We will organise (in January/Feb) an info-session on how to get best prepared for GSoC and present a strong submission. Stay tuned.
15/11/2022, 15:34:56 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): Thank you so much
15/11/2022, 15:35:07 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I assume you are gonna be our mentor for next year?
15/11/2022, 15:36:12 - Jmm: Being an Org Admin for Jenkins will be already plenty of work. But Org Admin as we understand it at Jenkins is also some sort of mentoring.
15/11/2022, 15:37:27 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I see
15/11/2022, 15:38:00 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I have experience with Python and Go, and a bit of C and C++ too. Hoping that would be enough.
15/11/2022, 15:39:10 - Jmm: Jenkins is mainly a Java application. üòêÔ∏è
15/11/2022, 15:40:50 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I am ready to learn Java when needed.
15/11/2022, 15:42:32 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I will start learning it from today itself.
15/11/2022, 15:42:44 - Jmm: I like that. So start learning by selecting a couple of issues (simple first and than more challenging).
15/11/2022, 15:43:23 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): You mean of Jenkins or Java?
15/11/2022, 15:44:45 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): What Java version does Jenkins use?
15/11/2022, 15:45:43 - Jmm: I mean: learning java (and Jenkins) by picking up an issue, study the issue by reproducing it,  read other people's code, and propose a fix (in Java)
15/11/2022, 15:46:41 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): From now itself? Ok
15/11/2022, 15:47:31 - Jmm: Have a look at the developer documentation. Jenkins is currently qualified for Java 11 but we are moving at a fast pace to make it compatible with Java 17.
15/11/2022, 15:48:06 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I see
15/11/2022, 15:48:24 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I will ask here when I have doubts or help is needed
15/11/2022, 16:05:40 - Jmm: For technical (programming) questions, you are better to ask on the developer mailing list. This channel is focusing on announcements and guidance about the GSoC program.

15/11/2022, 18:54:36 - anurag-sachan (Anurag Sachan): @jmmeessen:matrix.org Hi Jmm, last time I applied to Jenkins for the first time and was new to community, now that I have some basic understanding of Java, Jenkins (majorly pipeline), maven, plugins & microservices, could you guide me on how to make quality contributions and understand production level projects as I recently got rejected for MLH but I want to learn & do not want to miss GSOC 2023 opportunity.
17/11/2022, 18:48:42 - Jmm: An important characteristic of working on Open Source is that we work in the open and that everything is shared. People that participate to GSoC will learn and experiment this way of communicating and working.
I receive several invites for private conversations on Gitter. 

I prefer to avoid these 1:1 conversations. Please ask your questions or make your points publicly: there is no stupid question, others will benefit for the question and the answer, and there are no secrets to hide.
I understand that required to communicate publicly is difficult, gives you the impression to be in danger, and looks weird. This is probably completely new to many but it is part of the GSoC teaching and the ways of OSS.

You can mention me directly in public messages (and remind me if you didn't get the expected answer). But I will not get into private conversation. Thank you for your understanding.

17/11/2022, 21:38:14 - Jmm: Although we are quite early in GSoC2023, a lot of members of this channel are wondering how is works, how  to prepare, and many other questions. 
We are preparing an online session where we will answer as many question as we can. (The session will recorded if you aren't available at that time). We plan to have that first session begin December.

Stay tuned. We will announce this session on various channels.

In the meantime, read all the available documentation, on the GSoC, or on the Jenkins.io site (sub-projects menu). Of particular interest are the recommendations for contributors (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/)

And of course, get confortable with java development, read Jenkins documentation, install your own server and experiment. And look at some beginner issues and try to contribute to learn the process. We'll come back on this during our online session.

17/11/2022, 23:48:55 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Does Jenkins have any project based on spring boot ? Or just preferably focused over core Java 
17/11/2022, 23:52:10 - Ulli Hafner: No, we don't. Spring boot arrived after Jenkins was born. 
17/11/2022, 23:53:14 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): And also please suggest me the areas in the jenkin plugin where the Junit tests can be written means I want to start working on writting or improving tests for plugins where could I start ?

19/11/2022, 17:38:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Sure @shraddha761 .  https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin is a plugin that is looking for someone to adopt it.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/ is a tutorial of steps that can improve a plugin through a series of small, useful pull requests.  If that list is complete, then there is a Google Doc that lists many more ideas at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit#heading=h.hvd0nm6pz5o4

19/11/2022, 17:46:14 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): Hey @MarkEWaite 

Do you think I can pick some documentation good first issues too?

I would like to work on this one: https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin/issues/322


The only description the issue contains is:

`please show example with Declarative syntax`

This is not quite descriptive for me üòü



19/11/2022, 17:49:28 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): I understand what `declarative syntax` is. But I do not know what examples it speaks of? 

Is the `README.md` examples?
19/11/2022, 18:38:58 - halkeye: I would recommend looking into jenkins declarative syntax. It's a core part of pipelines and jenkins now.

The current examples in readme.md are scripted syntaz

19/11/2022, 19:49:19 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Please get in contact with me in gitter or better post a comment in the issue. I think there is a test for declarative pipeline.  So you can grab the test code and bring it in readme file as well  üòâ 
19/11/2022, 19:51:06 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Slowly is the file too big. So when you will bring more examples I will propose to create new examples.md file. 
19/11/2022, 19:52:49 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): So please write in the issue that you want do it and I will assign it to you. All of the discussions can be done there. And many thx for contributing

20/11/2022, 15:00:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @iqbalrohail there are also various publicly visible examples of Jenkins implementations that use configuration as code with the Jenkins docker image to maintain the contents of the container.  @halkeye:g4v.dev has a repository that others have referenced previously (I don't recall the URL).  I have a "strange use case" repository that I use for rapid setup and teardown of test configurations.  Sam Gleske has a git repository that helps as well https://github.com/samrocketman/jenkins-bootstrap-shared

20/11/2022, 21:24:15 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Hey there everyone! I'm Pratik, I want to contribute to GSOC'23 through Jenkins. Don't know if this is the right channel to ask this question. My doubt is about the Jenkins codebase. I've reading through the codebase for the past couple of days and trying to figure out how everything works. What timeframe do you think is required to understand the whole or at least the most important parts of Jenkins backend? (I'm familiar with basics of conventional Java and have experience with developing android apps using Java) I'm new to the Jenkins community so extremely so sorry if this question sounds sillyüòÖ
20/11/2022, 21:26:10 - Jmm: Hello and welcome pratik2315 (pratik2315) 
The short answer to your question is: It depends..... üôÇ
And your question isn't silly at all
20/11/2022, 21:27:07 - Jmm: To try to be a little more specific in my answer, it depends on how much time you can invest and if you are a quick learner.
20/11/2022, 21:29:06 - Jmm: There are several learning paths described higher in this thread. The advise on the GSoC and Hacktoberfest pages are also a very good start (and have several pointer to go further).
20/11/2022, 21:32:00 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Thanks for the detailed response @jmmeessen:matrix.org I'll go through the references you listedüëç
20/11/2022, 21:32:12 - Jmm: And first of all, try to install Jenkins locally and play with it. It will be useful to understand the GSoC project proposal and (newbie)  issue description
20/11/2022, 21:43:34 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Makes sense. Got itüëç
20/11/2022, 22:22:24 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): As @jmmeessen:matrix.org suggested to run Jenkins locally and play with it , it is also a plus point if you @pratik2315  start learning about Jenkins tool and have knowledge of ci/cd as currently I am doing the same to have good understanding of what actually Jenkins do ... Also I would suggest you to learn about junit to write improve  tests for various plugins 
20/11/2022, 22:24:39 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Seniors are requested to correct me if I am not right so I could improve myself too ...thanks
 
20/11/2022, 23:26:51 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Thanks man @iqbalrohail i appreciate the help. I have worked with Junit before so that may be a plusüòÑ
21/11/2022, 15:56:52 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Yes @pratik2315 it's good that you know junit , you can checkout some plugins and have a look on tests written in them . Check what you can do with them ...

However, ![I run into this error](https://imgur.com/a/e4OTgdG) . Till now, I have tried `mvn clean` and `mvn clean install` Commands. None of these seem to work. Therefore, I am working on all the suggested solutions [from](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45337558/failed-to-execute-goal-org-apache-maven-pluginsmaven-enforcer-plugin) . Shall keep all of you posted if I find a solution. I would also love some advice on the same.

15/12/2022, 12:49:13 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): `mvn clean install -Denforcer.skip=true` works , however, since I am new to maven and jenkins, I don't really know if they are the same thing.
15/12/2022, 13:04:09 - Ulli Hafner: The message indicates a problem in the pom.xml. It seems that some URLs are using HTTP and not HTTPS. So do not use `-Denforcer.skip=true`, better fix the problem!
15/12/2022, 13:08:26 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Whenever i get this error i check the java version in parent pom and use that jdk version. It works for me you can try it and also uske maven 3.8.6 it'll work fine 
15/12/2022, 13:40:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The maven version that you're using is too old.  You're using Apache Maven 3.6.3. 
 The Jenkins project requires Maven 3.8.1 or newer and recommends 3.8.6.  The default download from the Apache Maven web site provides 3.8.6. 
 See https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
15/12/2022, 16:25:26 - Dheeraj: Also, I find it helpful to look at the error messages to see if there's something I'm missing. In your screenshot, you can see the text:

`3.8.1 required to no longer download dependencies via HTTP (use HTTPS instead).`

And you can see that the maven version you're using is `Maven Version: 3.6.3`
That is why you're seeing the errors. So, please use the recommended 3.8.6 maven version.
18/12/2022, 09:17:29 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): All I had to do was upgrade maven and that worked wonders.. Thanks a lot

20/12/2022, 11:33:36 - Jmm: Hello daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas) 
I am guessing that you are facing the issue when trying to start Jenkins.io on your local machine. 
I don't have a clear view of what is failing at what stage so I will give it a few long shots.
- did it already work or is this the first jenkins.io make run you try?
- is your working branch in synch with the latest changes on master ? I know that some dependencies updates were made during the week-end. Always a good idea to rebase your working branch with the upstream/master branch.
- did you try to start your own copy of Jenkins.io on Gitpod (it is often a good reference to cross-check local configuration)
20/12/2022, 11:48:59 - Jmm: Note, daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas), there might be something smelly: my first own first attempt failed. Am investigating it.
20/12/2022, 12:05:00 - Jmm: False alarm (and my bad): it is always a good idea to do a `make clean` (cleaning the work environment)  after a dependency change and if things don't work as expected).

21/12/2022, 09:17:09 - halkeye: Those 3 screenshots seem to say the same thing. And the error would be much higher up in the output 
21/12/2022, 09:49:34 - Jmm: Hi daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas) ,
- Did you run `make clean` before (it fixed my setup yesterday) ?
- Is it possible to attach the whole output of the `make run` command ? 
21/12/2022, 10:50:16 - Ulli Hafner: Our https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/ page seems to be broken, the people images are too high, is this already known?
21/12/2022, 10:51:58 - Jmm: Oops. no, I am not aware of issues with that page (it is generated automatically). Looking into it (with a cleaned cache)
21/12/2022, 10:56:05 - Ulli Hafner sent an image. (Media omitted)
21/12/2022, 10:56:13 - Ulli Hafner: Hmm, seems to render not correctly in Safari. Chrome looks ok.
21/12/2022, 10:57:33 - Ulli Hafner: Even after cleaning the cache it remains this way...
21/12/2022, 10:57:37 - Jmm: Ulli Hafner: That is indeed ugly and broken 
21/12/2022, 10:58:12 - Ulli Hafner: Firefox is fine as well.
21/12/2022, 10:58:45 - Jmm: I only use Chrome as reference Web Browser. I will see if I can reproduce your glitch on my safari here.
21/12/2022, 11:00:05 - Jmm: The bug is confirmed: I have the same "uglyness" with my Safari
21/12/2022, 11:03:22 - Jmm: Will have a look how to fix this. This is the code used to generate the page: /content/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas.html.haml (probably a .css issue).Suggestion/correction is welcome
21/12/2022, 11:15:16 - Jmm: I have no clue where the mentor macro is defined. But I have only a very shallow knowledge of haml
21/12/2022, 11:16:13 - Jmm: I need help for this one
21/12/2022, 19:17:12 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): can you provide the complete stack trace?
21/12/2022, 19:31:26 - halkeye: <@jmmeessen:matrix.org "Will have a look how to fix this..."> https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/a04d54e3070e43c7b7f89fba21881a7a looks like height isn't provided so safari wants to just fill the height of the square.

22/12/2022, 00:35:08 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): For your own convenience, you should add your user account to the docker group so that you don't need to `sudo make all`.  

The message "Missing name for author" probably means that the site generator was expecting to find an author entry for you in the https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/tree/master/content/_data/authors directory. 
22/12/2022, 00:48:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're willing to push your local changes to a draft pull request on jenkins.io, it may be easier to deduce what's happening in the site generation process that is causing the failure.

I was working on this issue https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/issues/5778 and one of the solutions i could think of was that we can remove "< code >" tag from selectors_exclude , see here https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/config-file/#selectors_exclude-optional but i dont know where **configfile** for docsearch is present in the repository if its even there can somebody help me with where can i find it

thank you 
hmm that's intresting as there's no *selector_exclude* property in there so why does it by default not index the code snippets from what i've read in [DocSearch Docs](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/record-extractor) i'll look if there's a way to explicitly tell Algolia Crawler to index code snippets too
25/12/2022, 08:09:17 - halkeye: I think it already is indexing it, just body isn't weighted higher than titles

yes titles are mainly used and if the title is not proper relevant information can be skipped 
i have already raised a PR https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5841 but wouldn't it be awesome if we can highlight some portion in code too i searched and found out that you can add a paragraph tag inside code block in *.md files and crawler will index the things inside paragraph tag but *.adoc files dont have a tag like that normal text is considered paragraph in adoc

Thanks for the quick help 
How much time does it take i have ran `make user-site GITHUB_USERNAME=<USERNAME>` but it freezes 
here a photo of terminal

25/12/2022, 18:12:08 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): i have already tried other `make <target>` they all get stuck 
im using codespaces can that could be a factor ?

25/12/2022, 18:15:55 - halkeye: Stuck or a lot of cpu? I think the build process is pretty heavy
25/12/2022, 18:17:15 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): i have waited many hours before when i used only `make` it also gets stuck 
i'll try running them locally then 
25/12/2022, 18:19:55 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Oh it started again , sorry my bad
25/12/2022, 18:26:23 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): If after running `make user-site GITHUB_USERNAME=<USERNAME>` site is hosted on my fork of jenkins.io does it mean there's no failure after my changes?
sorry for asking too many questions 
thank you for your time 

25/12/2022, 18:35:29 - halkeye: I don't know if user site still work but it's supposed to create output that you can upload to GitHub.io pages. Lemme get out of bed and see what it does
25/12/2022, 19:01:03 - halkeye: oh yea it does publish
25/12/2022, 19:01:51 - halkeye: assuming it worked, it would have shown up at https://vandit1604.github.io/jenkins.io/ but you might need to enable github pages on that repo
25/12/2022, 19:02:06 - halkeye: do you need publish it? what are you trying to do?
25/12/2022, 19:02:21 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): yes it did i was testing my changes
25/12/2022, 19:03:03 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): so i thought if this works that means all tests passed
but i was wrong some checks failed when i raised a PR
25/12/2022, 19:03:20 - halkeye: `make` by itself makes the site and puts it into build/_site/sitemap, then i use a static server (ex `python3 -m http.server`) to serve that directory and test it

I checked crowdin.jenkins.io and obviously the plugin doesnt exist there and thats my task (I believe) to integrate with it. 
Where am I supposed to start? by creating my own workflow and building on it or something else?
I googled for like 2 hours but it didn't help much.
Can someone guide me?

27/12/2022, 04:21:54 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Should I be first submitting an issue at jenkins-infra?
If yes, should it be my repo or the jenkins repo link and who would be user(I checked and I cannot be the user)
27/12/2022, 04:22:22 - halkeye: i don't think those are things third parties can do, i think its one of the maintainers that has to set it all up, and want it setup. Warnings-ng is very heavily maintained. Is there a reason you picked that one to do ?
27/12/2022, 04:25:37 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): There is no specific reason to choose this issue, this was the first issue assgined to me and I was planning to atleast set crowdin for this project because I cannot do any translations
27/12/2022, 04:28:11 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Message deleted
27/12/2022, 04:28:58 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): I'll discuss with Ulli Hafner(Reporter of this issue) on this
27/12/2022, 04:29:19 - halkeye: it was assigned to you? i don't know enough about gsoc and whats going on.
Essentially you'd need to create some github actions (which is what your first screenshot says), you can do that as a fork, then submit it as a PR, but I think you also need to setup github actions secrets to talk to crowdin api
27/12/2022, 04:29:40 - halkeye: i'm no expert at crowdin though
27/12/2022, 04:34:21 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): > There is no specific reason to choose this issue, this was the first issue assgined to me and I was planning to atleast set crowdin for this project because I cannot do any translations

@MarkEWaite asked me to take a look at it and I believed that I'll learn setting it up since it has all the documentation to setup and I assigned it to myself

@MarkEWaite currently I am discussing this with Ulli Hafner(Reporter of this issue) on JIRA
If there is any other good first issue, please send me the link, so in case if I cannot work on the current one, then I can start on the next
27/12/2022, 20:18:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Subzer0570 you're welcome to continue the work on the CrowdIn connection for the warnings-ng plugin, though @halkeye is correct that the integration cannot be completed without the help of a plugin maintainer.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/ is the top level entry point in the documentation.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/translating-plugins/ shows the user interface for the translators as they provide the translations into their native language.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/crowdin-integration/ describes how to configure a new CrowdIn project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40H0bqGRiL4 is the recording of the Jenkins Online Meetup where @notmyfault1:matrix.org  illustrated how it works for developers and how it works for maintainers.

For a general overview of internationalization and localization alternatives in Jenkins, see https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/internationalization/
27/12/2022, 20:28:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Subzer0570 if you don't mind that the "first issue" has several different complications and may not have easy answers to all aspects of the issue, you could take https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-43052 in the git plugin.  I believe there are several steps that could be taken in that case, with each step being a pull request:

1. Warn to the build log when "Check out to a sub-directory" is used in a Pipeline job.  The challenge there is finding the correct location and determining that the currently running job is a Pipeline job and not a freestyle or matrix job
2. Find a way to hide the "Check out to a sub-directory" from the Pipeline Snippet Syntax Generator page so that Pipeline users don't see it presented as an option when they are using the snippet generator.  The challenge here will require learning more about Jelly as used in Jenkins and how to decide if a jelly page is being displayed inside the Pipeline Snippet Syntax Generator or somewhere else.

If you prefer to work on a series of pull requests, you could use the "Improve a plugin" tutorial at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/ to improve the clone workspace scm plugin at https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-clone-workspace-scm-plugin
27/12/2022, 20:30:57 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you'd like to be more involved in a deeper dive into a plugin that is related to one of the project ideas, you could help with the diagnosis of the test failure in the gitlab plugin pull request https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/pull/1375
27/12/2022, 21:47:12 - NotMyFault (Alexander Brandes): If you need help with the docs, just let me know :)
28/12/2022, 08:55:35 - Hrithik Goswami (batman005) joined the room
28/12/2022, 13:04:20 - Kris Stern: batman005 (Hrithik Goswami): A good start is probably going through the project ideas here https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ and start contributing via pull requests. 
28/12/2022, 13:05:36 - Kris Stern: We have also held a webinar to help you start and prepare for participation in December 2022 which can be accessed here at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_sTkGtTix8&ab_channel=Jenkins
28/12/2022, 13:07:16 - Kris Stern: And to get ideas about what issues to work on you can probably reference the guide we have for Hactoberfest 2022, which is still somewhat relevant: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#quick-start
28/12/2022, 19:44:36 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Hey everyone i was looking at this [issue](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-70142?jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened).  A thought popped in my mind , if the script generated by pipeline snippet generator closes the workspacei n which build is completed this will address the issue to some extent.
I would love to know your thoughts 
thanks for your time
28/12/2022, 23:58:46 - halkeye: should https://community.jenkins.io/t/new-to-open-source/5138 get moved to gsoc?  I'm putting it under contributing for now. Though it might be nice to have a canned/template response for this
29/12/2022, 06:07:36 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think it should be moved to GSoC.  I also think that we should have a canned response for that request
29/12/2022, 06:16:31 - halkeye: I wonder if chat gpt or someone here wants to make a response. I can convert a post to a template
29/12/2022, 16:41:13 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Looks like I actually read all the links you shared here previously, but sincerely thanks for sharing the links 
29/12/2022, 16:43:54 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): I'll look into this issue and with the PR you mentioned in the following message
29/12/2022, 18:15:06 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): I am trying to work on [this issue](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/WEBSITE-663) , however I would like to know : 
* Which acceptance criterion have been met in [this PR](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/2642)
* Which part of the PR needs work.
## So far:
* I have understood that :
*jenkins.io/participate is updated to reference¬†https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/internationalization/  in "Translate"*  is a criterion that has been met. Please correct me if i am wrong.

PS : jenkinsio builds successfully in my PC.  

29/12/2022, 18:48:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, that looks enough to me.  The other acceptance criteria in that issue report seem to already be satisfied.
29/12/2022, 18:49:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There is more information in that wiki page, but the transformation of that additional information to pages on www.jenkins.io is not a "newcomer friendly" issue
30/12/2022, 02:13:42 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): In that case , I shall find a
 new "newbie-friendly" issue.
30/12/2022, 12:40:48 - pushker001 (pushker001): Hey, @MarkEWaite I want to work on this idea can you guide me in this?
30/12/2022, 12:40:54 - pushker001 (pushker001): Screenshot Automation for Jenkins Docs 
30/12/2022, 15:55:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @pushker001 I don't have much more to offer than is already written in the project idea.  I assume it would use some form of web browser automation to open a series of Jenkins controller pages and would then take a screenshot of each of the pages that it opens.

30/12/2022, 21:09:58 - iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh): Hi, I am interested in mentoring the project [Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/).

30/12/2022, 21:59:02 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Welcome @iamrajiv .  Could you submit a pull request to that project that list you as a potential mentor?  https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/edit/master/content//projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool.adoc is the page that needs the addition

yes please
01/01/2023, 08:57:06 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): I ran the commands for which you were getting failing builds and the build succeeded everytime
so you can re-clone the repo and after opening the project let intellij sync some dependencies it'll take roughly 5mins

01/01/2023, 11:16:46 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Nope , did you try deleting and cloning it again?
is it still not working even after that?

01/01/2023, 14:54:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you know the version of Jenkins that you installed, then you don't need to provide the path to the jenkins.war file.  Use the `--jenkins-version` argument and provide the version number.  A search of your file system should find `jenkins.war`.  If not, consult the homebrew documentation for the common locations where they place files
01/01/2023, 15:24:25 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): if it worked on gitpod then locally it can be some system conflict/error
01/01/2023, 21:22:31 - ilya2s: Happy new year Jenkins community!

My name is Ilyass El Ouazzani and I am a first year computer science student at Universit√© de Montr√©al. I recently learned about the Jenkins project and am really excited to potentially contribute to it as part of GSoC

Before diving into Jenkins, I was wondering if there are any other tools (such as Docker) that I should learn about to build a strong foundation for working with Jenkins. I'm really interested in getting involved with the Jenkins community and contributing to the development of this amazing tool, and I want to make sure I have the right skills and knowledge to do so effectively.

02/01/2023, 07:46:58 - Kris Stern: ilya2s: It would be great if you could start by making some pull requests for some issues that need help with, for ideas of what issues you can work on you could perhaps get inspiration from say this page: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/. Even though Hacktoberfest 2022 has wrapped up the post can give you some ideas about where to start. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to let us know.

I read about [Exponential Backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) and [Jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter). as the project involves knowledge of how [Remoting](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting) works.

> Stretchable and shrinkable scope: If the intern is struggling, scope can be reduced to unification of the existing implementations, or merely implementing exponential backoff rather than exponential backoff and jitter. If the intern is doing better than expected, the scope can be expanded to writing a stress testing framework for the end result.

* https://github.com/jenkinsci - jenkinsci GitHub organization for Jenkins core, Jenkins plugins, and more
* https://github.com/jenkins-infra - jenkins-infra GitHub organization for Jenkins infra and documentation

* https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ - Contributing by preparing for Google Summer of Code 2023
03/01/2023, 16:24:21 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Many plugins provide an easy location to begin your contributions.  For example:
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/port-allocator-plugin - port allocator plugin needs more steps from the "improve a plugin" tutorial
03/01/2023, 16:25:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Once someone has completed the "Improve a plugin tutorial" they could look at the much less structured steps that are included in the "Contributing to Open Source" document

04/01/2023, 13:15:25 - Kris Stern: Hi Asrk03 (Arnab Sarkar) Aankirz (Ankit Kiran) Welcome to the Jenkins community! For a start please take a look at the project ideas we currently have for GSoC 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/ 

Many of these are in draft form with details to be confirmed. For an introduction to how to contribute to the Jenkins community this article may be a good place to start, although Hacktoberfest 2022 has already passed many of the ideas in it are still relevant: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/
04/01/2023, 13:16:29 - Kris Stern: It would be good to see which ideas that interest you the most and start doing some research as well as contributing via pull requests to solve the relevant issues we have.

Good initiative to work on that ticket.
There is no obvious answer to your question. Getting a reply depends on the availability and awareness of people that can help you.
It also depends of what type of question and guidance you are looking for.
- you can always try to ask your question here. If it is simple we can help you in this channel. Otherwise we can point you to the right channel
- general (development) questions can be asked on the Jenkins Dev Mailing list
- Using the dedicated gitter channel is a good idea too (ex architectural questions)
- if stuck in coding (ex test not working as expected), it is a good idea to start a PR so that people have a better look at your code and intend
05/01/2023, 10:02:28 - ilya2s: Merci pour votre r√©ponse mr. Jmm !
My question was 'CONTRIBUTION.md' readMe in the `/docs` directory. I had to struggle for a little bit to be able to Build the project and run it locally and I was wondering If I could update or add some details to the guide as my first contribution.

1 - The guide tells us to use `http://localhost:8080` to test the plugin locally. but in `/run/start jenkins.run.xml` which I guess is the run configurations maps to port 8085.
2 - in the same xml file I had to manually chage `jenkins.version` for it to run properly
05/01/2023, 10:05:20 - ilya2s: Is this something that needs to be adressed ? and if so can you please direct me towards the right ressources to do it

As a principle, PLEASE DO ! Anyone can propose a PR so that it can be discussed by the Community.

Submit a pull request with your suggestion. Your experience as a newcomer is a treasure and helping those that will follow you has an exceptional value.
Advise: make sure to have a separate PR focusing on these documentation improvements. Don't piggyback on other changes (new feature, code change). The PR should have a single topic.

For a start I would recommend using this article as a guide to see how you can start contributing pull requests (PRs) to the Jenkins community: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/

Even though the post was originally designed for Hacktoberfest 2022, it can also serve as a guide about how to get started for GSoC. 

Also, I would suggest going over the project ideas we are currently developing for GSoC 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/

Choose one to three that interest(s) you the most, then start doing some research to understand the relevant concepts better. You will have more than three months to prepare for your proposal, so it may be just about the right time to prepare for it better. 

For more background reading, please see: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/. There you will be able to find many resources.

07/01/2023, 14:31:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're planning to work with Jenkins in development mode on Windows, you may find it much easier to download the war file and run it from a command prompt window or powershell window with `java -jar jenkins.war`.  The Windows installer is a good choice for people configuring a server that they will regularly use and that they will upgrade weekly or monthly with new releases.  It separates the permissions of the service from the user installing the service.  However, that separation may get in the way of a developer.

07/01/2023, 15:22:13 - Kris Stern: I think we could somehow disable horizontal scrolling for the mobile version while keeping the original behavior for the desktop version. Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh) How confident are you with CSS?
07/01/2023, 15:23:13 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Im pretty confident with css i was just checking it out the bad commit
i'll raise a PR in some time
07/01/2023, 15:23:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, if you know how to do that.  Unfortunately, I do not know how to do that.  I suspect that the addition of the iframe at width 100% is what caused the issue.  That addition of the iframe was required in order to resolve the problem in the pull request that Kevin Martens detected while testing https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5726

07/01/2023, 15:34:08 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): That would be great, though my past experience with breaking changes to the site has lead me to generally revert the breaking change first, then allow a later commit to redo the reverted improvement in a better way.  If you can find a fix within the next 4-6 hours, then a fix is great.  If it takes more than that, then I'd rather revert first and have a new fix as a second commit later

However, the output shows that it was published to `https://rajiv.github.io/jenkins.io/master/index.html`, which is incorrect. This may cause an issue in the metadata of the website.

To fix the problem, I updated the Makefile to correctly retrieve my GitHub username and submitted a pull request for the changes.

I am now excited to give back to this wonderful community by becoming a mentor for the upcoming Google Summer of Code.

As a former GSoC student at Dask in 2021 and a mentor at Joomla in 2022, I believe that Jenkins would be the perfect organization for me to continue my journey this year. Can someone kindly guide me on how to get in touch with the right person regarding this opportunity?

14/01/2023, 14:06:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Chinni12102003 that message likely means that you are running git on Windows and you configured git to checkout with Windows style line termination (CR LF) while the plugin has an enforced code formatting convention that files should use the Unix style line termination (LF).  https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings describes it
14/01/2023, 14:30:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I've submitted https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/pull/512 to make the line termination configuration in the repository match the expectations of the code formatting convention of the repository.  If you'd like to test it, you could clone into a separate location with the command:
`git clone --branch=add-gitattributes-to-force-formatting --single https://github.com/MarkEWaite/plugin-installation-manager-tool.git`

That branch should pass tests on Windows (it does for me at least)

For a start I would recommend using this article as a guide to see how you can start contributing pull requests (PRs) to the Jenkins community: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/

Even though the post was originally designed for Hacktoberfest 2022, it can also serve as a guide about how to get started for GSoC.

Also, I would suggest going over the project ideas we are currently developing for GSoC 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/

Choose one to three that interest(s) you the most, then start doing some research to understand the relevant concepts better. You will have more than three months to prepare for your proposal, so it may be just about the right time to prepare for it better.

For more background reading, please see: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/. There you will be able to find many resources.

If you have any questions preparing please do post them here.

If you would like to run this project locally, the CONTIBUTING.adoc file is the best source to refer to.
16/01/2023, 04:43:03 - Dheeraj: The search query did not work for you because there's no "Health Scoring" plugin. What the project built (and is continuously building upon) is a tool (not a plugin) that calculates the Health Score of plugins.

That explains 0 search results when you tried to search for it in the plugins.jenkins.io site (which is a site dedicated to Jenkins plugins).

Indeed there is no repository for this as it is a completely new tool (with a lot of things that can be proposed).
In order to prepare and be in a good condition to prepare a powerful proposal, concentrate on learning how JCasC work and what configuration drift is. Build several test "benches". For this project, you should become an "expert" in Jenkins installation and configuration.
To learn about the contribution process, you can pick any beginner issue and use that to learn. Any issue in the JCasC domain is bonus.

Even I was noticing some problems in compiling the project, what worked for me what setting the $JAVA_HOME variable (as Gavin suggested above) to point to SDK 17. And then I appended $JAVA_HOME variable to my $PATH variable (exact steps might differ in win11).
20/01/2023, 17:34:17 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much @smilingprogrammer for pointing this out. It seems that the .env.example has some invalid values, and needs to be updated.

The error you're seeing hints that the variable `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON=* 5 */2 * * * *` has an incorrect value (ref: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/.env.example). It has 7 characters instead of 6. As a workaround, please delete 1 `*` from the end of this string and try again. Does this help?

My JAVA_HOME does have Java 11 path.  I am using three JDKS. Java 8, Java 11 for work and Java 17 for open source development and Jenkins. 

Would env variables like JAVA_HOME17, JAVA_HOME11 do the job?

You were right about incorrect configuration of JAVA_HOME. Once I resolved that it worked smoothly.

I set up the env variable then started  ran `docker-compose up`. 

The image was pulled. 

How can I explore more of the plugin. Like in GSoC videos there was database and a lot of other parts Dheeraj had explained. Where should I start to explore?

Which plugin?

> Like in GSoC videos there was database and a lot of other parts Dheeraj had explained. Where should I start to explore?

You can use the env variable to interact with the database. Try this:
`$ psql $POSTGRES_DB -h $POSTGRES_HOST -U $POSTGRES_USER`
`# select * from plugins;`
`# select * from scores;`
lmk if this doesn't work.

I'm not sure about the "best" way to explore the *Plugin Health Scoring project*, I would rely on experts on this channel with far more experience than me to correct me if I'm wrong somewhere. But here's how I would do it:

Before diving into the code, it would be a good idea to understand the purpose of this project. When you're able to answer the "What" and "Why" of the project, it's a good idea to head on to understand the "How" of this project.

Maybe start by taking a "tour" of the repo? Look at the directory structure, and get a bird's view of the purpose of each directory and the kind of files living there. Then start by reading the code. `ProbeEngine.java` is one of the important files, so maybe try understanding its code (remember that it's totally fine if it doesn't make sense straight away). I found it helpful to check the history of a particular file on GitHub and go to the PR which introduced those changes. I try to understand the purpose of the changes done to a file, which helps me get more context. The PR's body would link to an issue, and please read that issue to get even more context.

Try to see the table entries inside the DB, it will make things clearer about the data we're collecting, which would further help you connect to the code well. From the frontend's perspective, explore the various endpoints this project offers and check out how (and from where) the data is getting populated there.

Out of dozens+ probes already implemented, pick the one that makes the most sense to you and try to read its code and see how it's getting processed by the Probe Engine. On that note, please remember: Debugger is your best friend. :)

24/01/2023, 17:48:13 - Jagruti: Thank you so much for a detailed explanation dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) 

Exploring a tool, understanding code is a daunting task. I will take one step and follow everything you have said.

How do i convert the keys, since i only have the downloded key and no 'original' or 'converted key'
25/01/2023, 05:38:36 - Dheeraj: The 'original' key is the downloaded key.
And as written above the command: `Then you need to convert the downloaded key with this command` If you run that command, the 'converted key' will get generated for you.
25/01/2023, 12:19:33 - smilingprogrammer (Oyewale Abdulsobur): Thanks for the help @dheerajodha

26/01/2023, 11:46:27 - Kris Stern: Hi AagamShah2314 (AagamShah)  My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins. Welcome to the Jenkins community! 
26/01/2023, 11:47:25 - Kris Stern: So which project(s) are you interested in preparing for a GSoC application for? 
26/01/2023, 15:38:46 - Kris Stern: I think if you are keen about a certain project you should definitely work on issues that are related to it, that would allow you to strategically plan for your GSoC application. Also note that you can apply for more than one and no more than three. So do plan accordingly. 
26/01/2023, 15:41:09 - Kris Stern: Another aspect of the application would be your interaction with the Jenkins community at large, like how you ask questions, respond to replies, these all will factor in when we consider each application internally as an org. 
26/01/2023, 15:50:13 - Jagruti: I am unable to decide which project to aim for. 

Whatever project I pick the codebase is too complex for me to understand. 

I  am hardly able to contribute test cases to any plugin without guidance. 
26/01/2023, 16:16:36 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I am trying to work on the project Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) drift detector . For which I have been learning Jenkins and JCasC in depth inorder to come up with features like Drift detection, Sensitive data handling,Multi-instance support .and Comparison of Jenkins configurations. I also tried to work on issues in JCasC domain , but a lot of them are related to K8s and cloud technologies like AWS/Azure which are topics that I have just started to learn. Please may I know whether it is a compulsion to know them perfectly. I also request the mentors to kindly suggest if there is any other better approach to go ahead with the project.
26/01/2023, 17:04:37 - Kris Stern: No worries Jagruti, I trust you will be able to gradually gain confidence and insights once you work on a codebase long enough, but it will take persistence. 
26/01/2023, 17:12:12 - Kris Stern: <@lakshmishreea122003-63a2fc776da0373984a0cb1c:gitter.im "I am trying to work on the proje..."> I would recommend starting by working on some issues in the issues tracker for the JCasC repo at: https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin. That perhaps is the most direct approach to become familiar with the JCasC plugin. 
26/01/2023, 17:15:03 - Kris Stern: And Jmm  is the potential lead mentor of that project, maybe he will have something to add as to the best approach to prepare for the project idea. 
26/01/2023, 17:15:42 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the reply .

26/01/2023, 19:20:14 - iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh): [Jagruti](https://matrix.to/#/@jagruti1:matrix.org), to make the projects more manageable, try dividing them into smaller, more manageable tasks. Additionally, begin with simpler tasks or test cases to build your understanding of the project before moving on to more complex components. It's important to take your time and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance if needed.

Essentially the idea is you first disable security, then delete the old account, and then create a new user
27/01/2023, 16:01:46 - Kris Stern: Yes, agree with iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh) especially regarding the tests part. The existing unit and integration tests probably tell you more than you need to know as a newcomer to the codebase.
27/01/2023, 16:02:56 - Kris Stern: You may need to adapt the exact codes needed depending on your OS
27/01/2023, 16:21:54 - Akarsh-14_gitlab (Akarsh-14):   Yes tried this but i dont have that option called use security  xml code in that file .
27/01/2023, 16:44:43 - Kris Stern: Akarsh-14_gitlab (Akarsh-14): May I ask how you are running your Jenkins instance?
27/01/2023, 16:50:08 - Kris Stern: If you are just starting out on Jenkins and are running it on Docker, it may be better to kill the instance and start afresh with a new container might not be a bad option. 
27/01/2023, 17:44:54 - Jagruti: Thank you for your kind words Kris Stern iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh) 

Jenkins community has always been supportive to me.

 
27/01/2023, 17:45:56 - Jagruti: As of now,
I have not started contributing to any Jenkins project that are a part of GSoC ideas.


27/01/2023, 17:46:38 - Jagruti: I am trying to contribute test cases to various plugins.

28/01/2023, 06:59:08 - Kris Stern: I think it also depends on whether you installed Jenkins as a WAR file or as an installation, the path will be different for each case

I have installed docker containers to run the tool.

How do I see the table entries here? In the docker bash? Login through the .env variables credentials?

I am thinking of using 'yrzr/gitlab-ce-arm64v8' instead for my mac. Should i modify docker-compose.yml with this image?
And in the readme file of /src/docker only some docker owned directories are mentioned (incomplete maybe). I set up these paths :
/srv/docker/gitlab/config
/srv/docker/gitlab/data
/srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab
/srv/docker/gitlab/logs
/srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql
/srv/docker/gitlab/redis
/srv/docker/jenkins

Currently, I am a sophomore taking courses in college in San Francisco, CA and planning to transfer to UCB. I am interested in CI/CD, which saves developers a lot of time in building and deploying. I think it has a big impact and helpful to software industry. That's the reason why I choose to join Jenkins community. Actually, I use Jenkins to build and deploy my projects for a year. But I know a few for open-source projects and communities, and I think it's diffcult for me to understand plenty of concepts there, like: license, community, issue, PR and something like that. But gradully, I understand more now. At this time, I know Jenkins will also participate in GSoC, which is a goods news to me to make some contributions to open-source projects.
For now, I am planning to participate in a idea called "Plugin Installation Manager Tool Improvements", and I am trying to finish some candidate ideas there.
I am happy to be here. Let's make Jenkins community better and better.
30/01/2023, 01:37:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @mukundsrinivasb look at PluginManager.java for the `getPluginDownloadUrl` method.  It calls `plugin.getUrl()`.  That seems like a good place to start

I'm setting up jenkins to kickstart contributions here. I'm facing an error while following this tutorial: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven/

While I'm adding the path to my locally cloned repository to `Repository URL` field under the Pipeline tab, the following error shows up:
```
Failed to connect to repository : Command "git ls-remote -h -- /Users/shreya/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app HEAD" returned status code 128:

stderr: fatal: '/Users/shreya/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

I've tried putting the path to Git executable in `Manage Jenkins>Global Tools Configuration>Git>Git Installations` as `/usr/bin/git` but this doesn't work
30/01/2023, 17:00:24 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the said repo is cloned and is a git repo, I've checked it
30/01/2023, 17:00:38 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I'm running jenkins through Docker
30/01/2023, 17:01:23 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): can anyone help me out here?
30/01/2023, 17:04:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The path you've provided is incorrect.  The path needs to be `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app` 
30/01/2023, 17:06:01 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): @MarkEWaite even changing the path shows the same error
30/01/2023, 17:08:07 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): also, just curious as to why would I be putting `/home` instead of  `/Users/<name>`, as we've to put the path to our locally cloned directory right?

the doc did mention about mapping to `/home` in the jenkins container, I didn't understand that properly
30/01/2023, 17:39:10 - Jiakuang He (Sam): If you use Docker to install Jenkins, you need to make sure the container inside can access to this path.
30/01/2023, 17:41:03 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): When you clone the repository on Windows it must be placed in the location that the tutorial says, `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\simple-java-maven-app` (replace `<your-username>` with your Windows user name.

The command line that starts the Jenkins container in the tutorial mounts the volume `--volume "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%":/home`.  That maps `C:\Users\<your-username>` to `/home` inside that Docker container
30/01/2023, 17:41:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): With that mapping `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app` is the path to the repository inside the running Jenkins container
30/01/2023, 17:47:49 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Right, @MarkEWaite, understood.

I'm on macOS, so that means `/Users/<your-username>` is mapped to `/home` in the jenkins container, did I get this right?
30/01/2023, 17:48:33 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): @jkhe:matrix.org
okay, let me try this out, not so sure how to do this
30/01/2023, 17:53:10 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Use the precise paths as listed in the tutorial for the platform that you're using. I'm a Windows and Linux user and I'm confident that the Windows and Linux instructions work.  I believe that a colleague of mine confirmed the macOS instructions work on his mac.
30/01/2023, 18:00:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): afaik I did follow the instructions, but just to be sure let me start from scratch again

We'd like to switch those tutorials to be defined with Docker compose and be as simple to start as `docker compose up -d`.  Haven't done that yet

1. Please post the complete error output. The error you've shown might be related to another error somewhere else in the output. I think that using https://gist.github.com/ for sharing build outputs would be helpful.

2. Can you mention all the steps you performed and the commands you ran? This helps us try it our on our end and see if we see the same issue.

31/01/2023, 12:17:48 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Hello!
this is Shreya Bhagat, an Undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (in my third year), India. Have been coding for a while though mostly in Golang and python, but I'm new to open source. Have done elementary Java though - wanted to ask how much of a hindrance can being a beginner in JAVA be for my application.

I have worked in projects similar to jenkins - link:  https://github.com/sdslabs/gasper (its a Platform as a Service (PaaS) used for deploying and managing applications) and it's command line tool: https://github.com/sdslabs/gctl

I've followed through the tutorials which you have provided and ig I understand the basics of Jenkins. Now to start contributing, is it necessary that I take up issues related to the GSoC 2023 project Idea I'd apply for? Or I could pick up anything which seems doable to me?
31/01/2023, 12:25:35 - Jmm: 
Hello and welcome to the Jenkins Community, yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat) 

> is it necessary that I take up issues related to the GSoC 2023 project Idea I'd apply for

It depends on how comfortable you feel with your general knowledge of Jenkins and how to contribute. I guess that you already looked at the various "build your Jenkins muscle" advises (and online webinar).

Doing a couple of generalistic issues will be a good warm-up to get to know the product, the actors, and the way we work here. Then start digging and learning the topic you are interested in. The better you prepare, the stronger your proposal will be, the higher your chances to be selected for this year's GSoC.

31/01/2023, 12:38:19 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Thank you so much for your reply @jmmeessen:matrix.org !
Right, understood.
Yes I went through the build your muscle exercises, and found that pretty helpful
I guess I missed the webinar, is there a recording link?

Could you please help me with where to begin contributing? I also aim to participate in GSOC 2023 from Jenkins.
31/01/2023, 13:41:54 - Kris Stern: Hi mchirag2002 (Chirag Mathur)! Sure, have you taken a look at the list of 2023 project ideas at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/? It is recommended to have at least a few PR for any Jenkins related repositories, so I would recommend you to pick one(s) that interests you the most. If you are really keen to get your GSoC proposal accepted by us and Google, I think it would be wise to select two projects and submit two separate proposals in the same application in late March. 
31/01/2023, 13:43:12 - Kris Stern: I wouldn't recommend the [Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/) to you because it became clear to us that it will involve a lot of frontend development work.

https://gist.github.com/30af2103262ddd126b3519a2f1d6026b.git
But I have already created /var/jenkins_home/host_mnt/srv/docker/jenkins
thus not sure why I am getting this error?
And on running `mvn verify` build is successful(with some warnings) and on running `mvn hpi:run`jenkins is not starting giving error 404, while java application starts running.    
Any hints üòü
31/01/2023, 17:18:04 - Kris Stern: About the `mvn hpi:run`, have you made sure the global config is set properly?
31/01/2023, 17:20:48 - Kris Stern: Regarding Docker, have you made sure the folders at `/srv/docker/jenkins` and `/srv/docker/gitlab` (I would recommend changing these to something like`~/srv/docker/jenkins` and `~/srv/docker/gitlab\`) and make sure access is granted so that Docker can access these paths.
31/01/2023, 17:22:11 - Kris Stern: Since we are making our own Docker image based on a Dockerfile we have more freedom to choose the paths we want to use. And for macOS I think the HOME directory as the root directory would be more natural.

I think the relative path is relative from the home directory and not from user in the docker container. Then why are you suggesting that? I should be using absolute directories as working path in dockerfile. Anyways i tried what you said  and got this : ` ‚†ø jenkins Warning                                                                                                                                                              4.0s

Yes you are right but it would be more general to have the this path as only little things will be needed to change for running the plugin in macos thus helping the beginners who will be coming in later years to contribute.
31/01/2023, 18:12:59 - Kris Stern: Yeah, that's a valid consideration

See: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection

do you mean to say that due to apples sip even if user is granted root privilages still it will not be able to access /srv/? You are right,  its a bit drastic. I guess i will need to use the home directory.  Modifying home direcory files will not require root privilages so i think i will go forward with home directory. But the problem is osxfs on my docker :( I am also thinking of using /usr/local/srv to bypass osxfs issue but it will still require root privilages which is not a best practice to do.

The tutorial page https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/add-more-spotbugs-checks/#add-a-spotbugs-exclusions-file-if-needed tells you how to add an exclusion if needed.

If the exclusion is easy to fix or feels safe to fix (add a null pointer check, etc.), then you can fix it directly in the pull request.  If it is does not feel easy to fix or you do not have high confidence that the fix is exactly correct, then add the exclusion

@krisstern:matrix.org i created dockerfile because i wanted root privilages as i was accessing /srv but due to apple's sip i dropped the idea and instead used /users/ which does not require root access and thus no need of dockerfile.
02/02/2023, 17:37:50 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org as we are running jenkins and gitlab in an isolated container if we want to use an external postgres db,  we will need to configure the GitLab instance to connect to it by specifying the necessary environment variables, such as the database host, username, password, and port. Otherwise if we want to run a Postgres instance within the same Docker network, we would need to add a service to the docker-compose.yml file similar to the GitLab and Jenkins services and configure it to connect to the GitLab instance. To persist the data, we would also need to mount a volume for the Postgres service. I dont see any one of them implementedn in the code. What am i missing?
02/02/2023, 17:47:14 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): in the error logs of docker-gitlab this line - `execute[create gitlab postgresql user] (postgresql::standalone line 13) had an error` indicates that the command is executed inside the container that has a GitLab instance running and has access to the PostgreSQL database, thus creating a new user in the PostgreSQL database used by that GitLab instance.

03/02/2023, 13:36:39 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > Have you tried granting access to `docker` for the Postgres as well?

How to grant access to docker for postgres? I saw in the gitlab-docker logs that the username was root and password was `You didn't opt-in to print initial root password to STDOUT.`Nothing of this sort was mentioned in the Testing readme file of gitlab plugin. That is why i asked this question to clarify how was postgres used with gitlab :
> @krisstern:matrix.org as we are running jenkins and gitlab in an isolated container if we want to use an external postgres db,  we will need to configure the GitLab instance to connect to it by specifying the necessary environment variables, such as the database host, username, password, and port. Otherwise if we want to run a Postgres instance within the same Docker network, we would need to add a service to the docker-compose.yml file similar to the GitLab and Jenkins services and configure it to connect to the GitLab instance. To persist the data, we would also need to mount a volume for the Postgres service. I dont see any one of them implementedn in the code. What am i missing?


03/02/2023, 13:39:05 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): **In the process of figuring out how the `plugin-installation-manager-tool` works , I have learnt**
1. How to mount a local directory to the docker run process by using `docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app --name devtest --rm -it --entrypoint bash jnks-plugin-tool`
2. How to pass the local file to the jenkins cli within docker by using `jenkins-plugin-cli --plugin-file plugins.yaml`. The output of this command is pasted here. 

**What I plan to do today (4/2/2023)**
1. Pass the `jenkins-plugin-cli -p git:4.8.2_CMT:file:///usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins/git-4.8.2_CMT.hpi` as mentioned in [this](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/365) P.R ...  and see what happens ; I intend to contribute to the same.
**What I want to learn**
1. Which files are looked by the program while processing `jenkins-plugin-cli -p git:4.8.2_CMT:file:///usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins/git-4.8.2_CMT.hpi`

/srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql has to be modified to /Users/username/srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql i guess for mac.

Thanks so much for checking in, I really appreciate it!

1) Docker-based Jenkins quickstart examples (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/docker-compose-build/) i see jenkins image already in docker (https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins)  i want to understand better about the expected outcomes from the project if docker images already there.

2)Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/) in this project i understand that we need to build the jenkins.io website and related documentation, should we migrate the existing documentation or prepare them for the previous versions from scratch.
05/02/2023, 14:35:43 - Kris Stern: Hi prathi-mani (Mani Prathi) Thank you for your interest in participating in GSoC via Jenkins! My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins for GSoC. 
05/02/2023, 14:38:30 - Kris Stern: For your first question I would say the scope of the project is to rework some existing Docker-based Jenkins quickstart examples to make these more comprehensive and more accessible. And for this goal, we have from the project idea page:
> We could have a set of docker-compose files representing various types of Jenkins instances (simple Docker, Kubernetes, ‚Ä¶).
05/02/2023, 14:41:06 - Kris Stern: For your second question, the building Jenkins.io with alternative tools project is to prepare us to replace a tool called Awestruck with a set of new tools like Antora and Gatsby, so in a sense we will e migrating the existing AsciiDoc files to the new codebase.

05/02/2023, 18:22:40 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): everything is working perfectly. It actually feels illigal as most of the issues were solved by you. I didnt do much 
05/02/2023, 19:05:03 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org i modified the readme file : `In order to test the plugin on different versions of `GitLab` and `Jenkins` you may want to use `Docker` containers.
# Quick test environment setup using Docker for Linux/amd64

An example docker-compose file is available at `gitlab-plugin/src/docker` which allows to set up instances of the latest `GitLab` and `Jenkins` versions for linux/amd64. 

If they don't already exist, create the following directories and make sure the user that Docker is running as owns them:
* /srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql
* /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab
* /srv/docker/gitlab/redis
* /srv/docker/jenkins

## Quick test environment setup using Docker for MacOS/arm64

You need to modify the example docker-compose file available at `gitlab-plugin/src/docker` to set up instances of the latest `GitLab` and `Jenkins` versions for MacOS/arm64. 

Due to Apple's System Integrity Protection, you need to use the home directory as a root for the new directories to be created.

In the `docker-compose.yml` file :
    1. Change the ports to 
      - '55580:80'
      - '55522:22'
      - '55443:443'
      as the browser may block the ports in original docker-compose file.
    2. Change the gitlab volumes to 
        `/Users/yourusername/srv/docker/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab`
        `/Users/yourusername/srv/docker/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab`
        `/Users/yourusername/srv/docker/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab`
    3. Change the jenkins volumes to 
        `/Users/yourusername/srv/docker/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home`
    4. In your Docker-Desktop go to `Settings > General > Choose file sharing   implementation for your containers` and switch to osxfs(Legacy). osxfs(Legacy) utilizes more resources of the system so make sure that the assigned resources are sufficient by going to `Settings > Resources` otherwise Docker-Desktop may go to forever start mode on Restarting.
    5. Add `shm_size: '5gb'`under gitlab services.

Now for both Linux/MacOS users to start the containers, run `docker-compose up -d` from the `docker` folder. If you have problems accessing the services in the containers, run `docker-compose up` by itself to see output from the services as they start.

## Access GitLab

To access `GitLab`, you first need to create a user - `root` with some password. To do so, follow the following steps :
    1. In the Gitlab containers terminal inside Docker Desktop, type `gitlab-rails console` and wait for atleast 5 minutes for the console to start. 
    2. Once the console is started successfully, type the following commands:
        a. `user = User.new(username: 'root', email: 'root@root.com', name: 'root', password: 'setyourown', password_confirmation: 'setyourown')`
        b. `user.skip_confirmation!` 
        c. `user.save!`
    3. Now, point your browser to `http://localhost:port` and log in with `root` as the username and `setyourown` as the password. Then create a user for Jenkins, impersonate that user, get its API key, set up test repos, etc. When creating webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs, use `http://jenkins:8080` as the base URL.


If you have trouble cloning a GitLab repository, it may be because you have a leftover host key from an SSH connection to a previous installation of GitLab in Docker. To troubleshoot, run `ssh -vT git@localhost -p port`.

## Access Jenkins

To see `Jenkins`, point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. Jenkins will be able to access GitLab at `http://gitlab`.

Note: you need to change the security settings in `Admin -> Settings -> Network -> Outbound Requests -> Allow requests to the local network from hooks and services` in order for local webhooks to work.

For more information on the supported `Jenkins` tags and how to configure the containers, visit https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/.

06/02/2023, 07:10:43 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The container images that are used in the Jenkins tutorials are painfully complex.  The tutorials require a Docker network definition, a Docker in Docker container, and the Jenkins controller.  Then, the tutorial does the undesirable thing of running jobs on the controller, using Docker in Docker to run the jobs.

The dream of the docker compose idea is to use docker compose to dramatically simplify / hide all the ugly configuration steps that are in https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-multibranch-pipeline-project/ and the other tutorials like it.  Instead of defining a network and two or three containers, I want to `docker-compose upo-d` in order to have a working tutorial.  I want that tutorial to have 0 executors configured on the controller and to use either ephemeral agents or static agents to do the work.

06/02/2023, 16:58:46 - Kris Stern: Sure, but I don't think you need to do it that way. To remove a file from `git` you can do something like `git rm file-name` I think 
06/02/2023, 17:26:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): When a PR looks like a mess (happens to all of us), the most common pattern is to correct the mess with later commits, push the later commits, and mention in the comments that you would like the PR to be "squash merged".  The "squash merge" will collapse all the mess into a single commit.  The plugin commit history then looks very tidy and the pull request retains the comments and the insights and the education from the journey to the final commit.

There is an alternate called "force push".  It is much less attractive because it displaces or loses comments in the pull request. Don't do a "force push".

06/02/2023, 18:22:40 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi, I am trying to build the 'Plugin Health Scoring' project locally on my PC. I am trying to run the command 'mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip' as written in the contribution guide but I am getting this error
06/02/2023, 18:25:43 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I am also getting a 'This app can't run on your PC' error every time I run this command. Is it a problem related to my machine or maybe I am doing something wrong
07/02/2023, 04:10:11 - Kris Stern: Hi MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal) I am seeing "Access is denied" when you tried to run the `yarn` command... Have you tried opening PowerShell as administrator before this step?
07/02/2023, 04:11:36 - Kris Stern: If needs be, you may want to run the command
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
after opening the PowerShell as administrator before running any `yarn` or `npm` commands. 
07/02/2023, 05:07:28 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org i deleted the docker compose and settings file and commited the changes you suggested. Can you squash merge the pr.
07/02/2023, 05:08:12 - Kris Stern: Let me review it first
07/02/2023, 05:08:37 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > Let me review it first

ya sure 
07/02/2023, 05:20:39 - Kris Stern: I think we will need to add back the deleted `docker-compose.yml` file, other than that it looks okay. 
07/02/2023, 05:21:58 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > I think we will need to add back the deleted `docker-compose.yml` file, other than that it looks okay.

why should we add docker-compose file again? Anyone who reads the readme file should be able to modify their own docker-compose file i guess
07/02/2023, 05:31:40 - Kris Stern: We are not supposed to delete the original `docker-comnpose.yml` file for users to use
07/02/2023, 05:32:06 - Kris Stern: The problem is you have deleted the entire file so there is no file to modify
07/02/2023, 06:08:20 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi Kris, thanks for the reply. I ran the command 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted' in powershell and then the mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip command also with admin privileges but all I am getting is errors
07/02/2023, 06:08:51 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I think I might have to install a linux vm and work there
07/02/2023, 06:55:33 - Kris Stern: Sure, whatever that works
07/02/2023, 07:19:22 - Kris Stern: If this does not work we may try to use gitpod: https://www.gitpod.io/
07/02/2023, 08:18:26 - Dheeraj: > then the mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip command also with admin privileges but all I am getting is errors

Maybe some different error than "Access is denied"?
I personally love working on Linux distros, things would be easier there for sure.
07/02/2023, 09:00:10 - prathi-mani (Mani Prathi): Thanks Mark for your insights.
07/02/2023, 13:09:45 - Kris Stern: In case you are experiencing difficulty adding a file to GitHub, try first create the file, then run:
```
git add <name of file>
```
And then commit and push the file to the same branch as before

07/02/2023, 13:13:53 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I tried to build the jenkins.io documentation site https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io in the centos7 virtual machine. I followed all the instructions in the contributing guide with all the latest versions installed. Although the commands were executed successfully, I encountered an error when accessing the site at localhost:4242. It says 'This site can‚Äôt be reached The web page at http://0.0.0.0:4242/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.'  I would be grateful if you could help me resolve this issue.

07/02/2023, 13:15:28 - Kris Stern: Did you view the site at http://localhost:4242?
07/02/2023, 13:15:40 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org can i use this messed up pr of mine to experiment with git and github things. I didnt think that git will be this confusing
07/02/2023, 13:16:00 - Kris Stern: Or did you try to view the site at http://0.0.0.0:4242?
07/02/2023, 13:16:33 - Kris Stern: No worries, it normally takes a couple tries before you get it right with Git and GitHub
07/02/2023, 13:18:03 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I tried both. In order to check I also tried  curl  http://localhost:4242 this showed up a lot of HTML content but not able to access the site 
07/02/2023, 13:18:09 - Kris Stern: 0.0.0.0 means the browser is listening "on every available network interface"
07/02/2023, 13:19:00 - Kris Stern: Could you tell me what commands you have ran in sequence to spin up an instance of the jenkins.io site?
07/02/2023, 13:21:35 - Kris Stern: Normally I would start by spinning up Docker Desktop (as I use a macOS laptop), then I would run the commands `make` then `make run` and have to wait for a few minutes before the website shows up at localhost:4242
07/02/2023, 13:24:42 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): 1- sudo yum install -y make curl docker  2-sudo systemctl start docker then sudo systemctl enable docker
3-git clone https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io.git
4- cd jenkins.io
5- make prepare
6- make         the second time that i repeated these steps I used make run instead of make 



07/02/2023, 13:28:54 - Kris Stern: I don't think you need to run `make prepare` in step 5 if you will run `make` in step 6. 
07/02/2023, 13:29:24 - Jmm: Just by curiosity and to understand your setup, you are trying to connect from the browser on your laptop into a virtualbox (?) running centos and inside it a docker container with the web server?
07/02/2023, 13:30:43 - Jmm: if this is the case, make sure that the ports are opened and properly "forwarded" at every "enclosure"
07/02/2023, 13:30:50 - Kris Stern: Yeah, your setup could be why the browser could not access the port
07/02/2023, 13:32:08 - Jmm: If my hunch is correct, check whether from within VirtualBox (?) you can connect to the webserver (with curl for instance)
07/02/2023, 13:33:01 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org when i commit the changes i should commit step by step so that commit history is clean and understandable. And when i go to `files changed ` tab and delete a file from there (which is what i did with docker-compose and settings which i accidently pushed with readme file) i actually deleted the original file. i thought i was deleting the files from my pr only and thus only readme file will be left in my pr to merge, which i guess was a wrong thing to do. What i actually want to do is, i want to understand how to contribute to an issue (#1400) by opening a pull request for that issue(but what actually happened is #1403 was opened seperate from the issue which i didnt wanted) and i didnt quite understand how can i delete the original files from the master repo, i am not the project maintainer?
07/02/2023, 13:34:08 - Kris Stern: You can delete a file it the repo via a PR

07/02/2023, 13:36:39 - Kris Stern: I think you are supposed to carry out additional steps like the ones described here: https://www.thegeekdiary.com/how-to-open-a-ports-in-centos-rhel-7/
07/02/2023, 13:40:05 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the suggestions, I will try using curl to see if I can connect to the webserver from within the virtual machine. I will also take a look at the steps described in the article for opening ports in CentOS7 and see if I need to carry out additional steps to access the site. Will try again.
07/02/2023, 13:45:07 - Jmm: Way to go ,lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A) . Wishing you success in your exploration.
A good way not to get lost in all these "matrioshkas" (aka russian puppets) is to make a drawing of these environments and map the ports and networks.
07/02/2023, 13:47:33 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > You can delete a file it the repo via a PR

do you mean i need to checkout to a new branch, create an empty file with the same name, commit the change, push the change to my forked repo and then make a pr?
07/02/2023, 13:49:23 - Kris Stern: No, just create a new file with the same name docker-compose.yml on the same branch and start from there
07/02/2023, 14:02:31 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thank you, Jmm

07/02/2023, 18:12:12 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): CentOS 7 is not a great choice for current development.  It is very old.  It delivers very, very old versions of key programs like `git` and `ssh`.  I believe it also defaults to blocking ports unless they are specifically opened.

If you are not too far into it, I'd consider using a different operating system version.  I (personally) look forward to the day in 2024 when the Jenkins project will drop all support for CentOS 7.
07/02/2023, 18:14:32 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The maintainer of the plugin health scoring project is definitely not using a Windows computer.  He may be interested in improvements that help it work better on Windows computers, but that's not the primary focus.  If you are interested in that project, then a Linux machine or running inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is probably a better choice.
07/02/2023, 18:22:40 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the advice. I have windows. Can you please suggest a good way to build the jenkins.io website locally. I am ready to learn if I am unaware of the new build process. I desire to know the most preferred way.
07/02/2023, 18:40:28 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're on Windows, then you could look at the Windows Subsystem for Linux.  I have Ubuntu 22.04 installed on my Windows computer in Windows Subsystem for Linux.  However, I do not develop content for the jenkins.io site in WSL.  I have a Linux computer that I use for that task.

Ohh! Then whats the practical use-case of draft pr's? I need reviews and a lot of them üòì

08/02/2023, 09:38:45 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): So  it's fine If I don't  do It? 
08/02/2023, 10:00:34 - Ulli Hafner: Yes, you don't need the GITHUB_APP_KEY. This key is required when you want to test GitHub checks (these are reported after a build from the warnings and coverage plugins)
08/02/2023, 16:13:27 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): thanks Ulli, Shreya and Sayantan
08/02/2023, 17:46:39 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi, when I run the command 'mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev', I get this error 'java.lang.RuntimeException: Driver org.postgresql.Driver claims to not accept jdbcUrl, jdbc:postgresql://${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}'

After some Googling I think it means that the environment variables are not set, but I have created a .env file at the root of the project and populated it with the necessary configuration

08/02/2023, 17:49:23 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/nVum/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/nVum/image.png)
08/02/2023, 18:28:41 - Kris Stern: Hi Sayantan,
Let me see if I can reproduce the issue you have encountered with my local setup...
08/02/2023, 18:37:46 - Kris Stern: Have you started `postgres` locally before you run the command?
08/02/2023, 18:38:14 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Yes I have
08/02/2023, 18:44:41 - Kris Stern: Funny, I got `BUILD SUCCESS` after following the instructions... 
08/02/2023, 18:45:51 - Kris Stern: I see you have changed the database name though, but I have just used the recommended name `postgres`
08/02/2023, 18:46:36 - Kris Stern: Maybe tried using `postgres` for the `POSTGRES_DB` instead?
08/02/2023, 18:47:28 - Kris Stern: So this is what I used:
```
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
## What is the name of the database to use
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
## Which username should the application use to connect to the database
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
## What is the password of the user to connect to the database
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres-s3cr3t

# Configuration for the GitHub App
## What is the ID of the GitHub App
GITHUB_APP_ID=token_example
## Where is the private key to be used to authenticate to the GitHub App
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=path-to-private-key
## The name of the organization or user where the GitHub App was installed
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_NAME=organization-or-username

# Configuration of the application schedulers
## Frequency the update-center content is fetched
## This means on the hour, every two hours
UPDATE_CENTER_CRON=0 0 */2 * * *
## Frequency the probes and scoring processed are executed
## This means every two hours, five minutes past the top of the hour
PROBE_ENGINE_CRON=0 5 */2 * * *
```

08/02/2023, 19:44:15 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I am using the Maven cli and I might have to export the variables to the terminal to make it work

I have raised this Pull request [#163](https://github.com/jenkinsci/embeddable-build-status-plugin/pull/163) and testDoText is failing i'm trying to get status code back from Jenkins API so i can assert that. I have already read through https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/handling-requests/json/ in the hopes of finding something but couldn't get my head around some things there. Can you suggest me if my approach is correct on that test or am i doing something wrong
Thanks for Your time
10/02/2023, 11:51:15 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): hello, I'm having a hard time figuring out as to which gsoc project should I start working on/exploring. I've written a few tests for plugins and have a bug fixing PR in progress. 

I tried plugin-health-scoring and plugin-installation-manager-tool to get started, I didn't get many beginner friendly issues there which I could solve. I'm utterly confused as to how to start? all these projects do seem intimidating to me too
10/02/2023, 13:46:24 - Kris Stern: Hi yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat) Have you tried the two issues with a `friendly` label in the `plugin-health-scoring` repo at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afriendly? If you are interested we can work on some PRs together, just let me know.
10/02/2023, 13:48:01 - Kris Stern: BTW there is one new issue for the https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool repo today at https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/529. It is more docs related though. 
10/02/2023, 13:48:40 - Kris Stern: Also we have open Docs hours where Mark will be present and he welcomes any questions related to GSoC. You are more than welcome to attend.

> Have you tried the two issues with a friendly label in the plugin-health-scoring repo at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afriendly? 

these two issues are already taken up by some other participants
10/02/2023, 14:16:07 - Kris Stern: We haven't heard from impact-factor yet since he last said he is interested on looking at the issue. If you are interested maybe you can ask him whether he is still working on it. Since there is no active PR submitted for the issue you can work on it I think. Otherwise it may take a long time for another contributor to come along and pick it up later.
10/02/2023, 14:18:15 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay let me try this issue then, thanks a ton, I was lost for a while :')

-how does ci.jenkins.io testing work? (it's mentioned that it's the main point of this project )

No, you are not too late to start for this year's edition of GSoC. In fact, the list of accepted and participating orgs will not be released until February 22nd. 
11/02/2023, 20:56:06 - Kris Stern: To begin I would suggest choosing a project planned for 2023 from the list on jenkins.io at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/, then contribute via code as described at https://www.jenkins.io/participate/.

12/02/2023, 06:11:38 - Kris Stern: So I would suggest we look in the [src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring directory](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring) to find out where the scores are located and where to put scheduling code for the hourly job to be carried out.

That means your probe engine didn't run. Please set the PROBE_ENGINE_CRON env variable to some more frequent time (in the `.env.example` it uses the frequency: "every two hours, five minutes past the top of the hour")

can someone help me out here? how to supress a false positive SpotBug warning?
13/02/2023, 16:01:48 - Kris Stern: I think you will need to update either https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/test/resources/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/spotbugsXml.xml or https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/test/resources/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/findbugs/spotbugsXml.xml
13/02/2023, 16:03:32 - Kris Stern: Basically you will need to add a pattern to be excluded from the Spotbugs checks
13/02/2023, 16:04:18 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay lemme check this out
13/02/2023, 16:04:22 - Kris Stern: Hi Dneth04 (Nethra) No worries, which project have you been exploring? 
13/02/2023, 16:05:04 - Kris Stern: Okay, cool 
13/02/2023, 16:07:32 - Kris Stern: Though my understanding of it may not be very deep, basically docker-compose is kind of like an improved version of the Dockerfile at least in its usability and behaviour? 
13/02/2023, 16:11:44 - Kris Stern: I think the best way to approach this project is to actually go through the original examples and start to get a sense about how you may simplify things for the user. 
13/02/2023, 16:16:24 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): adding this tag over the code snippet there: `    @SuppressFBWarnings("NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH")` should work? 

taking cue from https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/13e438622940ea0029ec5615172d175b94bd5c04/src/main/java/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/findbugs/FindBugsParser.java#L43

13/02/2023, 16:24:51 - Kris Stern: I think what they have given in at [L43 of the FindBugsParser.java file](https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/main/java/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/findbugs/FindBugsParser.java#L43) is actually the section name `ClassFanOutComplexity`, but not the bug pattern, so your suggestion may not work. 
13/02/2023, 16:26:45 - Kris Stern: But you can try it first to find out for sure
13/02/2023, 16:30:35 - Ulli Hafner: > @SuppressFBWarnings("NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH")

Yes, this is the way to do. And add a `justification` as well.

13/02/2023, 16:32:21 - Kris Stern: Thanks Ulli Hafner for the correction

Port 50000 will be used when you have multiple agents. I think in this case we only have one agent in the same machine, so you don't need to worry about it. I guess we can have a separate section to explain more for multiple agents.

> how do I remove the container from docker:dind automatically(--rm command in docker)

You don't need to add the "--rm" command, it's completely fine for docker compose.

> how does ci.jenkins.io testing work?

Good question. I think I need to discuss more with other mentors before giving back the answer to you. Maybe you will need to update  the Jenkinsfile in here https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/Jenkinsfile . But, once again, I will let you know later.

> What should I do next

Thank you. You did well. Maybe, you can explore the Kubernetes too.
15/02/2023, 16:47:47 - Jmm: Docker-compose allows to define a multi-container environment. It defines how to build an image, create networks and automatic connection between containers, as well as storage.
See it as a meta-dockerfile. A very handy technology to learn and master: it allows to build complex test setups (front-end, back-end, database, etc)
The docker-compose documentation is well made.

20/02/2023, 15:26:07 - Kris Stern: Yup, so we will rebuild the documentation part (User Handbook and Developer Docs plus the rest) with Antora and the Blog with Gatsby with the "Alternate jenkins.io build tool(s)" project, but the first step must be the rebuilding of the User Documentation with versioning before the contributor moves on to the other parts of the project.

Gatsby will only be used for the blog, and not for the documentation which will be built using Antora. But it is true we may not need to use those Ruby `yaml` and `haml` files any more. 
20/02/2023, 20:12:54 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: I tried exposing my Jenkins localhost:8080 using ngrok, but got `Hook execution failed: URL 'https://https//dcee-14-139-38-200.ap.ngrok.io/job/gitlab-sample-job/' is blocked: Host cannot be resolved or invalid`. I will try finding my way tomorrow. Thanks for taking out time.

21/02/2023, 07:56:25 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: Isn't #1088 a pretty major issue as a basic functionality of using webhooks to trigger builds is unreliable. How are the users of this plugin even using this plugin with this buggy feature? Is this bug version specific?

And i tried to folk a plugin code from the jenkin's github page and while forking the repository and running it on my gitpod browser i am getting errors !! i have inserted the error page .Can Anyone please help me out to figure this out?
21/02/2023, 19:36:54 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Kris Stern: Can u please help me solve this ?
21/02/2023, 20:44:51 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Dneth04 (Nethra):  you'll need to provide more details about the failure and preferably provide them as text in a GitHub gist or elsewhere.  I guessed that you might be trying to use Java 19, but the tests of that plugin pass with Java 19.  I guessed that you might be using Java 17, but the tests of the schedule build plugin pass with Java 17.  I know they pass with Java 11.  Something else is wrong in that environment and we'll need more info to know what it is
21/02/2023, 20:46:18 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/schedule-build-plugin/job/master/lastBuild/pipeline-graph/ shows that the plugin master branch is passing tests on Java 11 Linux and Java 17 Windows.

22/02/2023, 07:48:03 - Kris Stern: Hi harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh) I meant to make this suggestion earlier, those the hours is limited for the free plan users, have you tried https://www.gitpod.io/?

22/02/2023, 12:07:43 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: in issue #1088 it states that `We are triggering the Jenkins job from GitLab webhook, the webhook test works fine, but when the job is actually triggered by a GitLab push or note event, it will fail with HTTP 500 error.` When I try testing by pushing even then I am getting HTTP 500 most of the times. only once it happened that webhook gave HTTP 200 but then when I tried to push changes through actual gitlab instance, again got HTTP 500. Is this a bug or I am doing something wrong on my end?

Hello to the developers! In Jenkins. My name is Aditya Rawat. I am a B. Tech student currently in my Sophomore year. I saw the tech stack required to be part of Jenkins, and I can say I have learned HTML, CSS, JAVA, and last but not least JavaScript. I do have a good amount of knowledge about GO (Golang), Docker ‚Äì Container, Kubernetes ‚Äì Container Orchestrator, and Jenkins ‚Äì CI/CD Pipeline.
 
Unfortunately, I saw the GSOC timeline today on 22, and I am here mailing you in hope of getting a chance or an opportunity to work with you all.
 
Regards,
Aditya Rawat
22/02/2023, 13:15:45 - Kris Stern: Hi Aditya Rawat No worries, we (Jenkins) have just been confirmed to have been accepted as a participating GSoC mentoring org, so you are not too late. 
22/02/2023, 13:17:01 - Kris Stern: You can still make a meaningful and significant pull request to bolster your application in addition to a reviewed (by us) project proposal (at most three is allowed per applicant). 
22/02/2023, 13:17:39 - Kris Stern: Do keep us in the loop which project idea(s) you are interested in working on so we can provide support where necessary.

22/02/2023, 16:19:55 - Kris Stern: You don't have to start it up via the client. Once you "spin up" your workspace on Gitpod your client will be automatically started if you choose Jetbrains IntelliJ as the code editor of choice.

22/02/2023, 16:25:16 - Kris Stern: Hi Aryanshrana (Aryansh Rana) It would be great if you could find an issue in the GitHub issue tracker for the [Jenkins Configuration as Code (a.k.a.

yup! was trying yo reproduce the error.
22/02/2023, 21:48:37 - Kris Stern: Cool, maybe meanwhile you should try more creative ways to troubleshoot the problem. 
22/02/2023, 21:48:43 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): actually I am using ngrok to expose my localhost and using https instead of ssh

22/02/2023, 21:55:34 - Kris Stern: Yeah, we know that the bug should be around the line at https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/blob/45c3881afe0341e9f9d8c0b55472aab5cc72b11e/src/main/java/com/dabsquared/gitlabjenkins/trigger/handler/AbstractWebHookTriggerHandler.java#L64. 
22/02/2023, 21:55:53 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): And is the issue #1088 version specific. I am asking because it's a pretty major issue if it is in all versions of gitlab. if users of plugin are not able to trigger jobs using webhooks then plugin is not much useful
22/02/2023, 21:58:12 - Kris Stern: I think even though the reporter of the bug has specified versions for the setup the bug crops up in all platforms, since we have no guard in place against this NullPointerException. I have an idea how to fix it too and it should be quite straightforward.

23/02/2023, 15:32:04 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Yup, that's the idea"> thats interesting. when I tried testing the webhook then also jenkins was exiting. so jenkins is giving npe during testing also for me at least(have you tried webhooks ?) in issue #1088, he said `We are triggering the Jenkins job from GitLab webhook, the webhook test works fine, but when the job is actually triggered by a GitLab push or note event, it will fail with HTTP 500 error.`which means wehook testing is working. need to understand this problem well. interesting ü§ì

I was searching for some research based implementation project and found- **Exponential backoff and jitter for agent reconnections** interesting. Have gone through the AWS blog and seems a good fit to work based on my interest.
Have decent amount of past experience working in Java.

I have done setup of Jenkins repo in local(had faced some minor issues but got resolved), trying to understand code flow now.
As a starter, can you please help me with pointing tips/ basic architecture to understand code flow.
Thanks
25/02/2023, 08:49:37 - lper1582 (Loghi Perinpanayagam): Hi tokaygeckot ,
For those people who are interested in Jenkins agent reconnection architecture, I would suggest this https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-agents/ as a starting point to play around with the agent - controller communication. It will be easy to pick up the underlying problem around reconnection.

If more interested, you can find the swarm plugin here https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm/https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm/ and can go through the code for existing implementation on how retry is handled there. I believe this will be helpful for the question.
Thank you.

25/02/2023, 20:22:34 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): btw, sorry for disappointing you. I read on stack overflow that using try-catch exception handling is generally not a good practice thats why asked you in previous issue whether I should use try-catch or not. you said yes if it passes all ci tests. thus I did so. now while solving this issue, I again asked because I thought maybe you could point me towards a better solution. I didnt want to assume things and just push a pr you know. I am a beginner, thus I want to learn, so I am asking questions even if it's the stupidest one. Regarding selection in gsoc, I am contributing because I want to have some real world experience and fill my knowledge gaps. it's very much fine for me if I dont get selected. my purpose of learning is getting fulfilled by contributing to jenkins and I will contribute till I become capable of making some major contributions in java. after that I will switch to some other organisation to contribute in go.

You may try alternative approach to try-catch but it may not work as intended.

26/02/2023, 09:12:36 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Using print statements to debug means writing `System.out.println("This Method is doing this");`
and
`System.out.println("This Method is doing that");`
this helps in debugging because you see what things executed correctly and what did not. This helps you to understand the flow of execution.
You can also print values used in a function that would also be very insightful

I am Dipanshu and I am delighted to know that our community has been chosen for Google Summer of Code 2023. This achievement is a result of the dedicated efforts put in by the members of our community.

After carefully reviewing the [Projects Idea List](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/) for this year, I have identified three projects that align with my relevant experience and skills.

1. [GitLab Plugin Modernization](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/gitlab-plugin-modernization/) : I've worked on  [test-results-analyzer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin) plugins and helped it modernize by merging multiple PR's.

2. [Add probes to "Plugin Health Score"](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/add-probes-to-plugin-health-score/)

3. [Displaying of Plugin Health Scores](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/displaying_plugin_health_scores/)


I have been following the progress of the [Plugin Health Scoring system](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/plugin-health-scoring-system/) project completed during the previous year's Google Summer of Code. The project was successfully completed by Dheeraj , who acted as a valuable contributor, under the guidance of MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) .


**I found myself in a state of confusion regarding the selection of a project to start contributing. Additionally, I am uncertain whether a contributor is allowed to apply for multiple projects from the same organization. It would be highly appreciated if someone could assist me in narrowing down my options and help me find some resources to get started.**

So far I have just done java little in deep, I have understood the project description, but I am not able to figure out or solve issues from GitHub relating to this project. I am not sure how to proceed with it . What step should I take forward so that it can help me understand basic issues under good first issue ? 
Should I first learn docker and GitLab then go for contribution ?

> It would be highly appreciated if someone could assist me in narrowing down my options.

I don't know how others would tackle this scenario but if I were you, I would read (and re-read) the project idea page of all the above 3 projects that you've mentioned. And my main aim would be to understand the scope of the project and see what are the expected deliverables.

It can be possible that you might not completely understand the scope or expected deliverables of a project idea. So, you can ask clarifying questions to the project mentors on this channel or on the project-specific channel (if it exists). By asking clarifying questions, you'd be able to understand what is expected from the candidate and what you would need to accomplish by the end of the summer. At this stage, your focus should be on analyzing the projects.

After getting an understanding of the scope and deliverables, you'd be in a better position to judge whether you'll be able to deliver the project by the end of summer or not. I would look at the tech stacks mentioned on the project and see how comfortable I'm with those (btw you need not know everything upfront), I would also look at which projects am I able to understand more than the others, and I would also look at which project interests me more (very important), and accordingly rank the project ideas. At this stage, your focus should be on analyzing yourself.

After you've ranked the project ideas, it is totally up to you to decide the total number of proposals you'd want to write and submit, (FYI: the upper limit is 3). So, based on how far is the deadline and how quickly I will be able to write a strong proposal, I would pick the number of proposals. You can keep all of your eggs in one basket or put them in different ones, up to you.

Does this help?

> help me find some resources to get started.

this depends on the project idea. As far as projects 2 & 3 are concerned, I would suggest you set up the plugin health scoring project's development environment locally. Check whether you're able to see the probe engine running and whether scores are getting generated and listed on the UI or not, and try to run the already-written tests. Read the code and understand how are things working, from where is the data getting fetched, processed, and then stored. Check out the "Issues" section of the project repository and you'll be able to find some open issues that you can contribute to. I think we need to work on creating some more beginner-friendly tasks but feel free to join the https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/GSoC-Plugin_Health_Score channel to ask for help. But remember, at this point, your main focus should be on working on your proposal, because submitting and getting your PRs merged is a very nice thing but not more important than writing your proposal.

  Configuration Management Tool: Chef                                                                                              5. Configuration Management Tool: Puppet                           i would like to know that are we restricted to use Antora only in our project?
27/02/2023, 22:19:22 - Jmm: Welcome Anshuman Shukla 
A lot of activity around this project idea happens in the GSoC-Plugin-Health-Score channel.
Also worth to note is that we are having a special meeting on that topic tomorrow. See https://community.jenkins.io/t/gsoc-project-ideas-presentation-plugin-health-score-probes-and-plugin-health-score-visualisation/5990
27/02/2023, 23:25:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Antora is strongly preferred because the Jenkins documentation is written in Asciidoc and Antora is a well-maintained tool that generates web sites from Asciidoc.  Other tools are much less likely to be accepted because after Google Summer of Code completes, we assume that existing maintainers will need to improve and modify the implementation.
28/02/2023, 05:58:21 - Kris Stern: Hi tokaygeckot Did you use your private key or public key for the key configuration?
28/02/2023, 06:48:21 - Kris Stern: I think I was able to get it to work on my mac:

28/02/2023, 06:57:07 - dipanshu: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "Regarding:"> Thank you so much for such beautiful insights and ideas.
I totally agree with ideas of analyzing myself and understanding the projects better. In the upcoming days I'll be working on the same and keep you updated üòä
28/02/2023, 07:58:39 - tokaygeckot: Hi Kris Stern ,
Using Ubuntu, generate key using `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key`
**private key** --> Jenkins Credentials (configuration same as snapshot)
**public key** --> docker agent (
```
docker run -d --rm --name=agent1 -p 22:22 \
-e "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=[your-public-key]" \
jenkins/ssh-agent:alpine
```
)
Is there a way to analyse and debug at what point it is going wrong, might be some misconfig from my end, I think.
28/02/2023, 07:58:50 - Kris Stern: tokaygeckot: Have you tried setting the Host Key Verification Strategy with Non verifying Verification Strategy?
28/02/2023, 07:59:53 - tokaygeckot: Nope, will give a shot on this too
28/02/2023, 08:00:29 - Kris Stern: Okay, cool
28/02/2023, 08:04:18 - tokaygeckot: Hi Kris Stern 
Same error
```
my-machine: Temporary failure in name resolution
SSH Connection failed with IOException: "my-machine: Temporary failure in name resolution", retrying in 15 seconds. There are 10 more retries left.
my-machine
```
28/02/2023, 08:06:01 - Kris Stern: I read somewhere for dealing with `Temporary failure in name resolution`, it would be worth to try restarting the docker service with something like

```
sudo service docker restart
```
28/02/2023, 09:13:44 - Kris Stern: Also tokaygeckot Can you show us how you pass in the public key during the step:
```
docker run -d --rm --name=agent1 -p 22:22 \
-e "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=[your-public-key]" \
jenkins/ssh-agent:alpine
```
Since it is a public key it should be safe to post it here. 
28/02/2023, 09:13:59 - Kris Stern: The syntax may be important
28/02/2023, 09:20:16 - Kris Stern: Or you could mask some parts of your public key with say like an `x` for security reasons but we will need to be able to see the syntax. 
28/02/2023, 10:28:24 - Anshuman Shukla (@anshuman-com:gitter.im): Okay Will join today for sure
28/02/2023, 12:30:51 - Muhammed Sabbah: Dears, Can anyone share zoom meeting link of today event https://community.jenkins.io/t/gsoc-project-ideas-presentation-plugin-health-score-probes-and-plugin-health-score-visualisation/5990 ?
28/02/2023, 13:05:24 - dhruvithakkar210: okay thank you !
28/02/2023, 13:31:21 - yuvichh: Hey Kris Stern I am working on JCasC drift detector idea, I was thinking of getting the current jenkins configuration snapshot using the "ConfigurationSnapshot" class. After that we can parse the jcasc file(yaml) and then check the current & desired configuration states. What do you think?
28/02/2023, 13:34:38 - NotMyFault (Alexander Brandes): I edited the post to make the link clickable, thanks for notifying us!
28/02/2023, 13:34:54 - dhruvithakkar210: i have found a bug in this page can someone pls help me to find out this page in repo ?https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/
28/02/2023, 13:39:11 - Jmm: Hello dhruvithakkar210 
I think that this page is generated and then updated.
The best to discuss this is to raise the point in the docs gitter channel.
28/02/2023, 13:40:25 - Kris Stern: Hi i-am-yuvi (Yuvraj Chhetri) Is there any issue you are currently working on?
28/02/2023, 13:42:30 - yuvichh: <@krisstern:matrix.org "Hi i-am-yuvi (Yuvraj Chhetri) Is..."> No, I'm currently not. Just figuring out how can I detect drift in current & desired state.
28/02/2023, 13:43:07 - Kris Stern: I think the architecture of the JCasC plugin is a bit more complicated than that though...

28/02/2023, 13:47:25 - tokaygeckot: Sure, will try this
28/02/2023, 13:47:31 - Kris Stern: There are spaces in your SSH public key so unless you put the quotation marks in the right places there could be problems
28/02/2023, 13:47:38 - Kris Stern: <@tokaygeckot:gitter.im "Sure, will try this"> Okay üëçÔ∏è
28/02/2023, 13:48:23 - Kris Stern: Would be good if you could work on some issues to get to know the codebase better and ask more specific questions
28/02/2023, 13:48:32 - yuvichh: Kris Stern: Any suggestions for me?
28/02/2023, 13:50:04 - Kris Stern: I would suggest working on some documentation-related issues first at https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/issues. Once you are more confident, try to fix some bugs. 
28/02/2023, 13:54:37 - dhruvithakkar210: <@jmmeessen:matrix.org "Hello dhruvithakkar210 "> thank you ! 
28/02/2023, 13:56:12 - yuvichh: sure I'll start working on some issues first
28/02/2023, 13:57:50 - Kris Stern: Hi dhruvithakkar210 I would suggested working more on non-documentation issue that are more relevant to the project idea you have chosen to work on to support your GSoC application, as there is roughly less than a month left before the application opens.  
28/02/2023, 14:06:06 - tokaygeckot: Hi Kris Stern , tried both combination "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY= ssh key" and "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY"="ssh key"
If I run `sudo docker container inspect agent1`
Env shows like this
```
"Env": [

                "AGENT_WORKDIR=/home/jenkins/agent"
            ]
```
Without "" , it was showing same too. I think some another issue is there. I'll explore if I can put debug pointer in code, where SSH is being verified.
28/02/2023, 14:06:46 - dhruvithakkar210: <@krisstern:matrix.org "Hi dhruvithakkar210 I would sugg..."> Thank you Kris Stern for your advice!  i would like to update you that i have already prepared my proposal and daily i'm trying to make things better in it.

28/02/2023, 14:08:46 - Kris Stern: Wait, I meant something like the following:
```
docker run -d --rm --name=agent1 -p 22:22 \

```
You can only have two quotation marks, and the JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY does not require any. 
28/02/2023, 14:09:45 - Kris Stern: So copying and pasting this does not work for you?:

I have been overwhelmed for the last few weeks with my office work and I wasn't feeling well in the last weeks
I want to ask that is it too late for me to go for gsoc23 if I resume now?
I had raised few PRs in January. I have seen the draft projects for gsoc23
I am aware that contributor applications start from march 20. Can someone guide me on how can I catch up?
I would really appreciate


 
28/02/2023, 14:29:11 - Kris Stern: No worries, I think you are still on track
28/02/2023, 14:30:14 - Kris Stern: But do remember to share your proposal with us to proofread it for you as well as to make suggestions, it sometimes take us to review your work so would recommend sharing at least two weeks early. 
28/02/2023, 14:33:59 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Okay Kris Stern 
I'll pick one or two
I'll resume to solve issues related to project ideas.
Also I'll check the office hours video on YT.
Is there anything I missed ?
28/02/2023, 14:34:11 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Like some discussion or announcement

28/02/2023, 14:47:12 - Kris Stern: I think it is the docker:dind (aka Docker In Docker) you needed when you first ran `docker run \ --name jenkins-docker \ --rm \ --detach \ --privileged \ --network jenkins \ --network-alias docker \ --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \ --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \ --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ --publish 2376:2376 \ docker:dind \ --storage-driver overlay2` on docker.

01/03/2023, 00:32:20 - Kris Stern: And, how did you enter your private key? Was it via choosing a file on your machine? If so make sure the permissions are correctly set. You can try something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45877135/9959070
01/03/2023, 00:33:20 - Kris Stern: I am saying this because I see `ERROR: Server rejected the 1 private key(s) for jenkins (credentialId:jenkins/method:publickey)` in your stack trace.

In the mean time, use community.jenkins.io (more efficient as it has mail notifications for new messages and other gadgets...)
01/03/2023, 10:51:40 - MsAkiNom: So, I have liked these projects and I would like to contribute to them

1.  https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/docker-compose-build/
2. https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/screenshot-automation/
3. https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/buiilding-android-app/

For some of these projects mentioned above, i am unable to find the rooms on Gitter. Does that mean I can ask any questions related to those projects in this room as well or will there be a separate group later on?
Thanks!
01/03/2023, 10:52:33 - MsAkiNom: oh sure! Thanks! :)
01/03/2023, 11:02:49 - Nikhil sinha: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/
01/03/2023, 11:03:38 - Nikhil sinha: i am interested in this project currently going through HAML and how to write it 
01/03/2023, 11:04:19 - Nikhil sinha: already forked jenkins.io but get overwhelmed by the amount of code  
01/03/2023, 11:04:57 - Nikhil sinha: could anyone tell me at least from where i can start 
01/03/2023, 11:19:58 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): Hi berviantoleo (Bervianto Leo Pratama),

I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I have been a little busy with college work. I have been learning Kubernetes for some time it was harder to wrap my head around it in the beginning but now I get the hang of it(I think), and I have some more questions regarding the project that I would like to ask:
- the old one about the ci.jenkins.io testing
- I was thinking if the project length is appropriate for a 12-week program. I don't have much experience so your guide will be helpful
- How should I proceed further with Kubernetes? as not much information is mentioned about it in the project details 
- I was thinking shouldn't the Dockerfile of step 4 from Linux and macOS section of https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/ be uploaded to the docker hub as an image
- What should I do about the docker-compose file I created earlier? How can I update it to https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/? Does it need more testing and documentation?
01/03/2023, 12:10:28 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): okay! so I was studying the whole codebase and the implementation of resteasy in the codebase. also took a look on gitlab4j api doc. I want to have a deep discussion on the purpose of different classes and packages and their interlinking. I would also like to discuss on migration process from resteasy to gitlab4j. i got pretty overwhelmed by the code-base honestly ü§Ø. i plan to submit proposal before 7th April
01/03/2023, 13:01:13 - dhruvithakkar210: <@sinhaniik_twitter:gitter.im "https://www.jenkins.io/projects/..."> As i'm also working on this project i will suggest go to repo -> solve issue   and start preparing for your proposal !  Hope this helps you.üôÇ
01/03/2023, 13:21:16 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Message deleted
01/03/2023, 14:06:36 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): I am going to explain each class in the codebase with architecture diagram explaining the link between classes and how they work together to integrate jenkins and gitlab via resteasy in my proposal. after that I can propose changes in the code for migration to gitlab4j via gitlab-api plugin. facing issue understanding resteasy implementation in code, documentation of resteasy is not helping much. 
01/03/2023, 14:07:48 - Kris Stern: Sounds good, but remember to include a timeline showing your time management and project planning ability in your proposal. 
01/03/2023, 14:14:40 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): also regarding testing, as the docker testing suite is broken, we will need to fix the testing suite first then only we can check time-to-time whether migration is going fine or not. so whats going to be done first - migration or test coverage?
01/03/2023, 14:19:26 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Sounds good, but remember to inc..."> its difficult for me to decide how much work I will be able to finish in how much time.

01/03/2023, 15:36:55 - Kris Stern: Hi Dhruv Jain Welcome to the Jenkins community! My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins along side JMM and Alyssa. Nice to have you with us. 
01/03/2023, 15:36:53 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Probably should fix testing firs..."> thats what I thought! but test suite is a stretch Goal for the project, can we do stretch goal before main goal?
01/03/2023, 15:47:24 - Kris Stern: Yeah, the thing is that the test suite is disabled at the time. So I would recommend it as a stretch goal. We currently have some unit tests in place for the plugin but that is a separate thing. So best approach would be to follow the recommended pattern of tasks as list out in the project idea page.
01/03/2023, 15:48:24 - Kris Stern: Hi Nikhil sinha Welcome to the Jenkins community! My name is Kris and I am one of the three org admins along side JMM and Alyssa. Nice to have you with us.

01/03/2023, 15:52:14 - Kris Stern: Hi MsAkiNom Yes, you could ask questions regarding the projects in some other relevant channels too to interact with the community.

01/03/2023, 17:45:52 - tokaygeckot: Meanwhile I had another question, to locally compile a plugin (to change code or debug), do I have to just download the plugin to Jenkins folder and maven will pick it up and compile plugin too or something else
01/03/2023, 18:06:27 - tokaygeckot: Hi lper1582 (Loghi Perinpanayagam) 
I was trying to locally set up swarm plugin.
When running `mvn hpi:run` 
It is giving me this error

Can you please help me with some hints, what is going wrong. Maybe some configuration I am missing.
Thanks
02/03/2023, 01:00:53 - Kris Stern: I hope I am able to interpret your question accurately: To compile a plugin if you run `mvn hpi:run` at the root of the directory Maven would build Jenkins for you. There is no need to start Jenkins separately. 
02/03/2023, 01:01:44 - Kris Stern: Hi Anil Vishwakarma It would be good if you could choose from amongst our project ideas one or two to work on.

02/03/2023, 14:21:31 - Kris Stern: Hi dhruvithakkar210 According to the Rules of GSoC:
> GSoC Contributors must submit Project Proposals to Organizations through the Program Website during the application period described in the Program Timeline. Each GSoC Contributor may submit up to three (3) Project Proposals; however, only one (1) Project Proposal may be accepted per GSoC Contributor.
02/03/2023, 14:23:33 - Kris Stern: Hi avinashnadendla (Avinash Nadendla) I would suggest working through the tutorials at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/ to get a feeling about how you could make these a more user-friendly set of docker-compose files representing various types of Jenkins instances (simple Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).

02/03/2023, 20:42:05 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Hi Community,
I'm interested in 2 GSoC Project Ideas and I have studied and gained confidence in both of them the projects are 
- [Exponential backoff and jitter for agent reconnections](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/agent_reconnections_exponential_backoff/)
- [Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/)

I have Contributions around [jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/) so i have some understanding about how things work in [jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/). On the other hand, the project [Exponential backoff and jitter for agent reconnections](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/agent_reconnections_exponential_backoff/) which equally excites me has issues that will take some time and digging into complex parts of remtoing. Although i would love to contribute to solve the issues in remoting. It will eat up my time when i should draft proposal and research accordingly to make it perfect
Now would not having PRs regarding remoting will affect the proposal review somehow? Should i draft a proposal for both?
Thanks for you time in advance.
02/03/2023, 23:46:06 - Kris Stern: The jenkins .war file requires a separate download which can be found via https://www.jenkins.io/download/
02/03/2023, 23:50:46 - Kris Stern: Hi Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh) I would highly recommend drafting proposals for both projects as you will need to take into considerations mentor availability in affecting your proposals' chances of getting selected as well. I think if you already have pull requests opened within the Jenkins ecosystem that should be adequate, as it already shows to us at least your facility in Git and GitHub. Now it is time to prepare for the drafts of your proposals and share these with the community for feedback and comments. 
02/03/2023, 23:55:08 - Muhammed Sabbah: I got it, Thanks Kris Stern 
03/03/2023, 03:11:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If macOS has the `locate` command, you might also be able to find the `brew` download location with `locate jenkins.war`

GSoC candidates interested in projects related to documentation and documentation tools are welcome to attend, ask questions, discuss ideas, etc.
03/03/2023, 04:36:26 - berviantoleo (Bervianto Leo Pratama): 1. Regarding ci.jenkins.io, I think you can add to the existing job https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/Jenkinsfile#L11 or add new a job. Regarding adding a new job, you will need to provide the Jenkinsfile first before we will ask someone to set up the job in ci.jenkins.io.
2. Sure, don't worry. I believe the community will help you too.
3. As per my previous answer, if you think it will not fit for a 12-week program to do the Kubernetes, feel free to not include that in your project plan. I understand the Kubernetes part will be harder than the docker-compose.
4. I think it will a good option if we have a docker image that's already set up with the plugins. We can explain the docker image. But, if you don't think so, it is also a good option to have a Dockerfile like now.
5. You can update the documentation from this file https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/content/doc/book/installing/docker.adoc. It will be good if you can run the documentation project on your computer, so you can check directly after updating the documentation.

"Does it need more testing and documentation?" Yes, you should update the documentation, for testing, you only need to test the `docker-compose.yml`, it would be sufficient.

The funny thing is that in my hands I was learning about DevOps. I was in dire need of a project like this. My start with Jenkins was not the smoothest,
with finding solutions to many of them scattered on the Internet. So I think the great thing about this project is that it's easy to get started with Jenkins for anyone trying to get started,
and So I am sure of the importance of this project at the starting level to deal more with Jenkins, So is there a separate place to discuss the parts that will be there, or some suggestions from the Mentors and thank you for your time

03/03/2023, 23:18:14 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): I am planning to write my timeline in detail by trying to define the changes to code that needs to be done but as I have explained approximately all classes of the codebase, my proposal has actually become quite lengthy. it will easily go above 30 pages, even with font size of 11. üòì do you guys have any problem with long proposals?
03/03/2023, 23:21:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): pushker001 (pushker001):  as far as I understand it, no one has offered to act as the lead mentor for that project.  Without a lead mentor, it is unlikely to be accepted by the Jenkins project in GSoC 2023.  You're welcome to work on further improvements to that project as part of your learning, but without a lead mentor, it is unlikely to be part of GSoC 2023
04/03/2023, 00:38:19 - Muhammed Sabbah: Kris Stern: MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) 
04/03/2023, 01:16:39 - Kris Stern: pushker001 (pushker001): That project was accepted for last edition of GSoC in 2022, but not for 2023. 
04/03/2023, 01:20:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Be sure that you're using  Java 11 and that you're using Maven 3.8.4 or newer.  Try building first from the command line, without IntelliJ.  That will confirm your Java and Maven versions are working
04/03/2023, 01:20:47 - Kris Stern: I think a good proposal should be no more than between 10 and 15 pages long... Maybe you can trim the part about the background if you have such a section, since these are common knowledge to anyone who knows Jenkins. You may want to keep ideas about the project on your proposal though.

I am looking forward to learn devops and work on this project and this is my action plan currently: 
1) Watch a  video on jenkins and how to create a CI/CD pipeline by integrating it with github

2)watch 5 videos on jenkins plugins modernisation(which were recommended to me on this chat room)

3) Get a basic understanding of maven

4) Learn how to use gitLab

6) Start with fixing the good first issue in project


Is this pathway optimal for someone who is looking forward to learn devop through open source?

_____________________________________________________________________________________
My name is Marinica Denis Andrei, I live in Bucharest, Romania, Eastern European Time (GMT+2). As a bachelor's degree, I graduated from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Robotics, "Robotics and Computer Science" department, the final grade obtained being 9.5/10, having as a diploma project the realization of a robotic cell for depalletizing, labeling and repalletizing of cardboard boxes integrating an ABB IRB 760 articulated arm industrial robot from the ABB company. To complete the diploma project, I realized the 3D simulation of the entire robotic cell using a microcontroller from the ABB company, internet networks and signals created in the ABB Robot Studio software. I made the simulation using python and C# scripts. We also made a matrix of accelerations and rotations for the integrated robot, calculations of tangential and centrifugal forces made in Matlab and an automatic tracking system made in python.

I am currently a master's student at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, at the Faculty of Automation and Computer Science, majoring in "Computer Science, Advanced Control and Real-Time Systems", the grade obtained in the entrance exam being 10/10. I have already started the dissertation project, continuing the bachelor's project. This project involves the realization of the physically articulated arm type robot, the components being made through the additive manufacturing process (3D printing), integrating Arduino components and servomotors. For this robot, I started programming two offline and online applications. The programming of the industrial robot is done through the Arduino IDE and the C programming language, the robot having commands that it can take from the serial bus. The offline application is made with the Python programming language, having several panels that can interact with the operating system and CAD-type programs, tracking signals, positions that can be transposed in graphic form, control of individual servomotors and the control carried out on coordinate axes correlating several servomotors to achieve the movement. I have also integrated an online application, an application created as a back-end using the Python programming language, the Flask library, Jinja, pyserial (for transmitting serial signals to the robot), mathplotlib (for making graphs), pandas, numpy (for reading a document with a code already registered for programming the robot), SQL and pylogin (for the registration in a database of each account created on the online application), various APIs for webscraping of information displayed in real time from (Google search , google scholar, youtube, google patents), BS4 and Selenium for webdriver automation and information retrieval through webscraping. Also, the front-end part is made through HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, Bootstrap5, MediaQuery. The application also has an authentication and creation system for user accounts and a 2-factor authentication system, through which the user enters the email address and receives an automatic verification code.

I currently work as a System Engineer in the Continental Automotive company, ADAS Autonomus Mobility department. The technologies used are C, C++, Python, CAN, SPI, ETHERNET. On the requirements side, I use IMS, Jira, Confluence, DOORS NG, Jazz. I am assigned to 3 different projects, 50 percent I work on the "Market Intelligence and Concept Development" project, it involves the analysis of the global market and products for the improvement of Continental products, the creation of scripts with trend and seasonal data prediction algorithms, the creation system architecture (hardware and software), extracting data from the Internet and filtering them through webscraping technology and creating relevant charts for market analysis. All this is done through Python, C and Matlab languages.

For the rest of the projects, I am assigned 25 percent each, the first one being "camera, ultrasonic and satellites", realizing the software and hardware architecture together with the domains, and the other project being (DeepDrive) for which I analyze the image from the camera at the pixel level, detection, distances with Python and C.

In the past I worked as a Software Test Automation Engineer in the Luxoft company for the creation of a camera for detection, processing and transmission of signals to the ECU. I analyze exports from the script based on a test plan. The csv exports were the values of all CAN and SPI signals for each frame. Also, with each software release, we inject new software by flashing the camera, test and realize certain events in Canoe and create automatic testing scripts, automatic flashing.

Statement of Motivation
_____________________________________________________________________________________
My motivation comes from my passion for the software field, all my hobbies are related to this field, I have always tried to occupy my time developing my programming knowledge, I constantly follow courses for programming, computer science, I constantly do problems on leetcode for C , JS and Python to practice my logical thinking and develop a lot.

I really want to be accepted in the Google Summer of Code program because I want to develop myself, I want to learn as much as possible to have a very solid portfolio of projects and experience and to be able to apply all the knowledge I have.

I was actually thinking that doing just the docker-compose one will be too little work for the 12-week program. So I want to add Kubernetes to my proposal too but I don't understand what I need to do in the Kubernetes part  

I'll run the documentation project on my computer tomorrow, thanks for all your help and guidance 
04/03/2023, 22:23:39 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Screenshot automation for Jenkins Docs seeks to automate the steps that Kevin Martens performed manually in the pull requests identified by https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Akmartens27+is%3Aclosed+DOCS-5624
04/03/2023, 22:25:09 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Screenshots in the documentation help users understand what they should be seeing on their screen.  As we move towards a user handbook that is version specific, the screenshots will also need to be version specific.  We won't want to spend the human time to do what kmartens27 (Kevin M)  did with those pull requests.

05/03/2023, 01:31:32 - berviantoleo (Bervianto Leo Pratama): Yes, agree. It will take a short time if only working with the docker-compose.
¬†
For Kubernetes, you will need some manifest files like deployment, services, etc. You might need to learn how Kubernetes work. I suggest learning some components, for example, deployments, service, and pods. For testing the Kubernetes locally, I suggest using minikube or K3s.

Great, feel free to post in here if you got any problems when running the project.
05/03/2023, 02:15:22 - Kris Stern: Hi Pushkar Mahajan Welcome to the Jenkins community! My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins along side JMM and Alyssa. It is nice to have you with us.
05/03/2023, 03:21:42 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: `The success criteria of this project would be a release of the GitLab plugin without a RESTEasy dependency and with a gitlab4j-api dependency, all without regression to end users.` which means that I need to migrate from resteasy to gitlab4j retaining the features the plugin already has. when you advised me to think about some original ideas about modernising the plugin, I now have some, but the project does not involve improvements of the plugin, its just migration. so should I research on how the improvements I thought would be implemented or I can just mention it in my proposal as some possible ideas and focus only on the migration part as stated
05/03/2023, 04:43:46 - Kris Stern: Yes, and also note the following:
> The primary maintenance issue with the GitLab plugin is the use of a very old version of RESTEasy. The goal of this GSoC project would be to replace usages of this library with usages of gitlab4j-api via the GitLab API Jenkins library plugin, normalizing the GitLab plugin‚Äôs use of the GitLab API with regard to the GitLab Authentication, GitLab Branch Source, and GitLab Logo plugins.

And also pay close attention to:
> A particular challenge with this project is to ensure that there are no regressions for corner cases:
>
> * Unauthenticated proxy servers
>
> * Authenticated proxy servers
>
> * Proxy servers and TLS URLs
>
> Handling these corner cases should be feasible with the new library, but the existing logic will likely need some modifications. Testing proxy authentication is a bit laborious, but it can be done with various Docker images.

Logically the "new ideas" would come in the form of how you approach the modernization workflow, how to make sure there will be no regression for the corner cases, and also how you would systematically carry out testing to facilitate the proposed work. 
05/03/2023, 04:44:21 - Kris Stern: Your GSoC proposal does not need to be long, but it will need to be effective.

I am quite educated in Java, and was looking for a good place to start on the "Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) drift detector" project.

05/03/2023, 09:33:26 - srmalkan: Hello everyone, 
I am Smit Malkan graduated from Mumbai University in 2021 and started my journey as a software engineer at Morgan Stanley (India). Here I got the opportunity to work on various technologies such as Springboot, Apache Kafka, Zookeeper, ReactJs, Jenkins, Docker and many more. I became an instant fan of Jenkins soon after the pipeline was introduced in Morgan Stanley later last year. If I get the opportunity, I would like to work on either "Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) drift detector" or "Exponential backoff and jitter for agent reconnections".

Currently, I am going through the code base for JCasC and will soon try to contribute to relatively easy issues.

Also, Unfortunately, I was unable to attend earlier meetups, would like to know if those sessions were recorded or not.

I am excited to express my interest in the project located at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/docker-compose-build/. This project particularly aligns with my experience of working on projects involving Jenkins. I possess prior knowledge and experience of working with docker-compose files, however, in relation to Kubernetes manifests, I would appreciate further clarification regarding the expected outcome and what is required of me.
05/03/2023, 17:55:37 - Prachiti Parkar: Hello everyone! I am currently a master's student studying Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I completed my bachelors from VJTI, Mumbai and have 2.5 years of work experience working for SAP and Morgan Stanley. I am well-versed with Java and have exposure to cloud tools such as Kubernetes and Docker. I am interested in contributing to Jenkins as a part of GSOC 2023. I am interested in below project ideas.
1. Displaying of public health scores (Motivation - Learn React.js)
2. Add probes to "Plugin Health Score"
3. Exponential backoff and jitter for agent reconnections.

I am new to open-source as well as GSOC. Can anyone help me as in how to get started or prep for the proposal .

Thanks in advance.

05/03/2023, 18:37:43 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): I have a question regarding [Exponential Backoff and Jitter for agent reconnection](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/agent_reconnections_exponential_backoff/#background), In the background section it is stated about the unification of retry logic in swarm plugin and in remoting but swarm uses Options class to support 3 retrying logics which are normal retry, linear attempts at retrying and Exponential backoff, [see here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/swarm-plugin/blob/master/client/src/main/java/hudson/plugins/swarm/RetryBackOffStrategy.java) but if you see in [RetryBackOffStrategyOptionHandler](https://github.com/jenkinsci/swarm-plugin/blob/master/client/src/main/java/hudson/plugins/swarm/RetryBackOffStrategyOptionHandler.java) you can see that Exponential Backoff is the default logic.

Will this also be implemented in remoting? The choice between retrying logics?
Gentle ping to the Potential Project Mentors.

05/03/2023, 19:03:16 - lper1582 (Loghi Perinpanayagam): Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh)
The idea is to have these logics in one unified place(probably in remoting as swarm is a wrapper of remoting). Swarm plugin already has this option. Apart from swarm, there are lots of plugins using the remoting internally which does not have this back-off retry mechanism. You can feel free to try different stratergies(one or more options). 
05/03/2023, 19:04:20 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Alright that clears things for me!
I'll add this in my proposal 
Thanks for your time

06/03/2023, 14:13:03 - Kris Stern: chir263: Have you chosen a project idea or two to write your GSoC proposal yet? If not I would highly recommend doing so from the list we have for GSoC 2023 at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/. It would be highly recommended to submit at least one pull request to any one of the GitHub repositories within the Jenkins ecosystem. For more details about how to start, please see https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/.

06/03/2023, 15:02:36 - Kris Stern: HI Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh) It may not be a bad idea to cross post any questions you may have on the "Exponential backoff and jitter for agent reconnections" project idea on the Jenkins Discourse at https://community.jenkins.io/tag/gsoc since the lead mentor for the project [Basil Crow](https://community.jenkins.io/u/basil/) is not currently monitoring this channel.

If yes this is the jenkinsci/jenkins gitter channel

It looks like your question has been asked by other GSoC prospects. Kris Stern, org admin has provided an answer for this so i'll copy and paste it here for consistency.   First of all choose a project idea or two from our list for 2023 to focus on at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/. Once you have picked the project idea(s) to work on a proposal towards you can then submit a pull request or two preferably on a relevant issue to show that you know basic Git and GitHub which is a prerequisite skill for open-source software development. Then you should prepare a proposal or two and share a copy with us to review and comment on prior to submitting it via the online GSoC application form.  Proposal template is at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIlPLXfLbFsvcaHFuwmH9_lSCVm9m6-SgNYTNAnSZpY/edit?usp=sharing  Hope that helps.

I'm thrilled to be here, and I'm eager to participate in this year's GSoC. I recently discovered the Displaying of Plugin Health Scores project and I'm really interested in it, but I'm worried that I might be a little late to the party. Is there a way for me to catch up and get up to speed? Also, I'm wondering how I can start working on this project. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!
08/03/2023, 11:06:55 - Mostafa Ashraf: Hello Tonya Liu Welcome to the Jenkins community! My name is Mostafa. It is nice to have you with us. You can start looking to available project ideas, if one of ideas might be interested.
Also as we have less than a month before the official opening of the online application form, you may want to start working towards submitting a pull request or two and also to start writing your draft proposal, which you can share with us for review and comments as soon as you have a rough sketch. 

This can be done by posting the relevant Google Doc link here or at https://community.jenkins.io/tag/gsoc

08/03/2023, 14:14:05 - Kris Stern: You could alternatively discover some new issues and submit report for these on GitHub and follow these up with pull requests. Or if you are confident you can even work on some bug fixes. 
08/03/2023, 14:15:19 - Kris Stern: The existing section is at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/ and the hosting repository is at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io.

10/03/2023, 07:50:41 - shashank sah: rahuldas6009 Welcome to the Jenkins community. First, you need to find the projects in the repository where java is being used.
There are the two links for jenkins repositories :
1> https://github.com/orgs/jenkinsci/repositories
2> https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-infra/repositories
 And from that project, you can see the open issues, that are flagged as `good first issue`.

10/03/2023, 14:22:32 - Kris Stern: If you can find the time you should submit at least one pull request for including in your application as well 
10/03/2023, 14:24:42 - Kris Stern: Yes, I think that maybe a very good idea if you are certain the script does what the is intended. Also, if the script is more proof-of-concept or is a prototype, be sure to indicate clearly as well.

I am excited to begin contributing to open source projects. As a newcomer to the open source community, I am currently struggling to find good first issues that are suitable for beginners like myself.

I would be grateful if anyone could provide me with some guidance on how to find good first issues in Jenkins or point me in the right direction towards beginner-friendly issues.
11/03/2023, 06:10:45 - Saarthak Maini: Hello Bilal Malik ,

Welcome to the open source community!

I can understand the problem pretty well as I was in your position 1 year ago

Here are some links , websites and tips which would help you find good first issues:

Go to the repository on Github , click on the issues button , click on the Labels button , search for "good first issues", and you'll find  plenty of beginner friendly issues

Link for Jenkins Beginner Friendly Issues:

https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-70778?jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly%20

Another action which you can take is that you can go to the public mailing list of the Organizations and ask for suitable good first issues there


There are also many websites which provide with a list of Good First Issues. 

One example of such website is https://goodfirstissue.dev/
You can search for more of such websites on Google

You can also checkout the Github Explore page here:

https://github.com/explore

Hope This Helps

11/03/2023, 07:38:19 - Kris Stern: Better still if you see there is some improvement you would like to introduce to the [jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/) website, you could open a new issue and see what the feedback is before working on a pull request for it.

11/03/2023, 09:35:36 - Saarthak Maini: I think you can use the following for reference and solving the issue:

11/03/2023, 10:45:32 - Dneth04 (Nethra): HI Saarthak Maini  Thanks for looking into, but I am confused where should i exactly make changes?
11/03/2023, 10:51:03 - Kris Stern: Hi Dneth04 (Nethra) What do you mean by "opening my jenkins instance"? Are you referring to the jenkins.io codebase? Or are you referring to a particular Jenkins plugin? 
11/03/2023, 10:53:34 - Kris Stern: Also, do you have any idea why in the screenshot we see the Thougthworks XStream mapper being invoked? Which JDK are you using BTW? 
11/03/2023, 10:54:58 - Kris Stern: HI Saarthak Maini Are you someone participating in GSoC 2023? My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins. I see you have been very active in this channel recently and would like to understand your situation a bit more. 
11/03/2023, 10:56:03 - Kris Stern: Hi Saarthak Maini Are you reviewing as a fellow GSoC applicant? I do not see your name as one of the mentors.
11/03/2023, 11:02:48 - Kris Stern: Hi Tabitha Mutiso Our official calendar for all events including the weekly GSoC office hours can be found at https://www.jenkins.io/events/. Starting from the coming week the time will be moved to 3pm UTC, and the duration will be approximately 30 minutes each moving forward as we have finished introducing each of the project ideas.  
11/03/2023, 11:03:32 - Kris Stern: Hi Saarthak Maini The info you have provided is incorrect. 
11/03/2023, 11:05:08 - Kris Stern: Due to Daylight savings time we are moving our GSoC Office Hours one hour early to 3pm UTC. And, as mentioned during the meeting on the past Thursday UTC, the meetings moving forward will be shorter and approximately 30 minutes each. This is because we have already introduced all of our project ideas. 
11/03/2023, 11:06:30 - Kris Stern: Also Saarthak Maini To avoid misinformation from being distributed like this, it would be better for org admins or project mentors to handle such questions moving forward. There may be potential conflict of interests for you do carry out tasks that are normally handled by the admins or project mentors. 
11/03/2023, 11:27:35 - Kris Stern: There are currently not enough info for us to see what is wrong with your setup. Would be great if you could provide more details. 
11/03/2023, 11:32:47 - Saarthak Maini: Hello Kris Stern ,

Yes, I'm currently participating in GSOC 2023 as a student contributor. I'm currently in my sophomore year of college.

I would like to work on the project "Docker Based Jenkins Quickstart Examples" and am currently drafting my GSOC Proposal which can be found here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bGCY7Wh2IvgXXONm9bIDV0Km_v_xrrv-Rzgi0ydHJ0/edit#heading=h.oy2p8aba4b0l

Yes, I have been active in this channel for sometime now and answering various questions.

The reason is that I want to get involved more with the community. 

Some of the questions received on channel were the problems I faced a while ago, hence as I was able to relate to them , I thought to give a descriptive answer for the same as it took me sometime to figure it out on my own when I faced a similar problem and it would help the other person.

Also, I am trying to give feedback/suggestions to other proposals from my side. I'm doing this because in the process I will get some ideas which I can implement in my own proposal,also help other fellow contributors in improving their proposals ,collaborating with them and also I guess it was mentioned in one of the Office hours that we as a community can give each other feedback

I would also like to be active in other channels but I decided to start with this one and then go on to the other channels when I get used to being active on this one first

If there is anything I need to improve with respect to the proposal or being involved in the community in general , please let me know and I'll make the necessary changes

Thank You Very Much!
11/03/2023, 11:33:11 - Kris Stern: You may need to check the version of Jenkins installed
11/03/2023, 11:36:07 - Kris Stern: Hi Dneth04 (Nethra), it looks like your issue is relevant to this https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-3685. But they were saying something called Hudson which is now Jenkins I think... 
11/03/2023, 11:39:45 - Saarthak Maini: Kris Stern:  I apologize for the misinformation, I have mentioned the same in the message that it would be 1 hour earlier but I may have provided the wrong document. 
11/03/2023, 11:40:31 - Kris Stern: Thanks for your feedback Saarthak Maini I do understand we encourage some degree of interaction amongst the potential GSoC contributors, but it would be good to keep in mind issues like conflicts of interests as you are currently not acting in the capacity of either an org admin or a mentor. Originally I thought maybe you are a new mentor since you were greeting fellow contributors as though you are one of the moderators, hence my confusion. Thanks for clarifying! 
11/03/2023, 11:41:06 - Kris Stern: No worries, I think we will need to update the docs eventually
11/03/2023, 11:43:24 - Saarthak Maini: I apologize for the misunderstanding

11/03/2023, 12:06:23 - Kris Stern: Dneth04 (Nethra): Can you tell me which GitHub repository are you using as the codebase for starting the Jenkins instance? Also, can you tell me what Jenkins version you have installed locally or in your dev environment?
11/03/2023, 12:07:01 - Kris Stern: The assumption is you should not need to do any codebase changes before you can start your Jenkins instance.

I can simulate 10 user threads via Jmeter but i need an Endpoint which should be something like this **$jenkinsurl/manage/computer/\<endpoint>**. Even after searching the code base of both Remoting and Jenkins i wasn't able to figure it out.
I wanted to know if i'm searching in the correct place or not.

For more context: I want to track the retry time of each thread when the controller rejects threads i.e 10 connections.

Jenkins Plugin Architecture: Jenkins is a highly extensible system and its plugin architecture allows developers to add new features and functionality to Jenkins. Plugins can be developed using Java and the Jenkins API.

Plugin Types: Jenkins plugins can be of various types, such as Build Step, Post-build Action, SCM, and more. Each type of plugin provides specific functionality and integrates with the Jenkins pipeline in a different way.

Plugin Development Environment: Jenkins provides a Plugin Development Environment (PDE) to make it easier for developers to create plugins. PDE includes tools such as the Plugin POM Editor, which generates the plugin's POM file, and the Plugin Wizard, which generates the initial plugin code.

Jenkins API: The Jenkins API provides a comprehensive set of classes and methods that allow developers to interact with Jenkins. It includes classes for managing jobs, nodes, builds, and more.

Testing Plugins: Jenkins provides a testing framework for plugin development, which includes unit tests and integration tests. Developers should thoroughly test their plugins before releasing them to ensure they work as expected.

Publishing Plugins: Once a plugin is developed and tested, it can be published to the Jenkins plugin repository. The Jenkins plugin repository is a central location for hosting and sharing plugins with the Jenkins community.

Plugin Documentation: It's essential to document the plugin to make it easy for users to understand how to use it. Documentation should include information on the plugin's features, how to configure it, and how it integrates with the Jenkins pipeline.

In summary, developing a plugin for Jenkins requires a good understanding of the Jenkins plugin architecture, the Jenkins API, and the Plugin Development Environment. With the right tools and knowledge, developers can create high-quality plugins that enhance the functionality of Jenkins.
11/03/2023, 18:28:49 - Hassan Refaat: Hello Jenkins Community,

My name is Hassan and I am excited to be a part of this community. I work as a backend developer and have gained considerable experience in Java, Docker, Spring, and Jenkins in CI/CD. However, I am facing some difficulties in understanding the code base and figuring out how to get started with Jenkins. It can be overwhelming to navigate through a new system, and I feel like I could use some guidance.

Nevertheless, I am willing to put in the effort to learn and improve my skills in Jenkins. I believe that with the help of this supportive community and the abundance of resources available, I can overcome these challenges and become proficient in Jenkins. Thank you in advance for any assistance and advice you can provide.

12/03/2023, 05:33:17 - MitAbhay (Abhay K. Mittal): Hey, Kris Stern  I have been drafting my proposal for the idea "Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools" for the GSoC. I have some queries for the same : 1. Can you clear about the UI/UX improvement point mentioned in the project idea? Are we talking about the UI/UX improvement of the whole site or only of documentation pages that we will build?
12/03/2023, 05:36:55 - Kris Stern: Hi MitAbhay (Abhay K. Mittal)When we draft the proposal we have in mind the UI/UX improvement of the whole site. However, the tricky part is if the scope of project proposal does not include the whole site, let's say you only choose to work on the documentation alone, then you may consider  improvements to only the parts you plan to work on. But if you have decided to include everything to your site, then it should be the entire site for certain.  
12/03/2023, 05:43:52 - MitAbhay (Abhay K. Mittal): ohk then timeline will differ accordingly what I chose.
12/03/2023, 05:48:42 - MitAbhay (Abhay K. Mittal): One more query : idea is saying to develop the user documentation with versioning and developer documentation without versioning. Is this correct? Why we don't need the versioning in developer documentation?  
12/03/2023, 05:51:09 - Kris Stern: Yes, that is correct. This is because the content of the developer documentation would not change and is independent of the Jenkins version. 
12/03/2023, 05:56:08 - MitAbhay (Abhay K. Mittal): Ok, thanks for clearing this one.
12/03/2023, 05:59:19 - MitAbhay (Abhay K. Mittal): And one last, what this line actually mean in the idea statement "the blog can be split from the documentation using something like Gatsby, which is expected to make it easier for users to submit posts in the future." It is little confusing as our blogs are already separated from the docs, and we don't have the functionality to post the blogs as user.
12/03/2023, 06:05:11 - Kris Stern: Currently to post to the blog you will need to open a pull request with a new AsciiDoc for the new blog post. Moving forward the blogs alone will be built using Gatsby. 
12/03/2023, 06:27:39 - MitAbhay (Abhay K. Mittal): Ok, I got it. Thanks again for clearing everything. I would like to share my draft proposal for review and suggestion once it's get complete.
12/03/2023, 09:07:48 - srmalkan: Hi,
can anyone explain in layman language what is Descriptor in jenkins terminology ?
is it plugin related configurations ?
12/03/2023, 09:16:07 - Kris Stern: Do you mean a layman version of this?: 
> Descriptor is an object that has metadata about a Describable object, and also serves as a factory (in a way this relationship is similar to Object / Class relationship). A Descriptor / Describable combination is used throughout in Hudson to implement a configuration/extensibility mechanism.
12/03/2023, 09:17:04 - Kris Stern: Cool üòé
12/03/2023, 09:56:20 - srmalkan: yes

May be its full of flaws, but would love if you can suggest me how can I improve it to the best.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tiVyWSqobOAVXZGHN56viiHoguXe3EY_tSdClZmGbNs/edit?usp=sharing
12/03/2023, 11:28:14 - Sujal Gupta joined the room
12/03/2023, 14:11:53 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): From what i could understand when i first read through the comments inside the code:

describable and descriptor both are objects but descriptor contains some information about the describable object.

Describable is a car and descriptor is information related to that car like colour,model etc. Also you can add more features to that car by updating descriptors without updating the describable objects code.

Project mentors please correct me if i'm wrong.

13/03/2023, 09:40:54 - srmalkan: Hi 
I am working on JCasc project idea where we need to detect drift in configuration, I would like to know if there is a way to get configuration Mapping Node from just a dry run ?  
There is a checkWith() method which checks if the yaml configurations applied will run into any error or not but it just returns issues with the yaml source.

is creating such a workflow included in the scope of the project idea?

14/03/2023, 11:08:01 - Jmm: Hello smilingprogrammer (Oyewale Abdulsobur) 

The idea I had in mind was to get the existing Jenkins configuration by exporting it either via the UI or, better, via the Jenkins CLI. 
This will generate a JCasC YAML file with the current configuration as described in https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/docs/features/configExport.md
14/03/2023, 11:10:06 - Jmm: This configuration YAML should be compared with the JCasC configuration on file. The difference is the drift. Note that the compare will need some intelligence to be meaningful (order, default values, etc)
14/03/2023, 11:13:08 - Jmm: The code for the CLI command is https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/plugin/src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/casc/cli/ExportConfigurationCommand.java and the tests are at https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/plugin/src/test/java/io/jenkins/plugins/casc/yaml/ExportTest.java
14/03/2023, 11:15:20 - Jmm: I don't remember the exact CLI command to export the configuration. To find it out, have a running Jenkins system with JCasC installed and use the CLI command `help` : it will display all the available commands.
14/03/2023, 12:15:58 - Kris Stern: Only the blog will be built in Gatsby in the end 
14/03/2023, 12:18:23 - MitAbhay (Abhay K. Mittal): And the remaining site will be of ?
14/03/2023, 13:06:12 - srmalkan: Jmm Thanks for the resposne.

yes there is a export feature , but the problem with exporting configuration is that it includes other basic configurations as well.  which we don't necessarily supply in yaml file. 
14/03/2023, 13:08:08 - srmalkan: so then if there is a drift we cannot accurately detect it because we cannot predict what configuration changes are due to basic configuration and what are due to actuall manual changes.

14/03/2023, 13:31:18 - Utsav-06 (Utsav): does anyone knows the process of plugin development?
14/03/2023, 14:19:57 - Giridharan002 (Giridharan002): <@utsav-06-639b57116da0373984a09b99:gitter.im "does anyone knows the process of..."> Certainly, here are the general steps involved in developing a plugin for Jenkins:

Set up your development environment: Install Java and the Jenkins Plugin SDK. You can download the Jenkins Plugin SDK from the Jenkins website.

Create a new plugin project: Use the mvn hpi:create command to create a new plugin project. This will create a new Maven project with the necessary files and directories.

Implement your plugin: Write the code for your plugin using Java. You can use the Jenkins API to access and manipulate Jenkins data.

Test your plugin: Use the mvn hpi:run command to run Jenkins with your plugin. This will allow you to test your plugin in a live Jenkins environment.

Package your plugin: Use the mvn package command to package your plugin into a .hpi file.

Deploy your plugin: Install your plugin in Jenkins using the Jenkins web interface. Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" > "Advanced" > "Upload Plugin".

Publish your plugin: If you want to share your plugin with the Jenkins community, you can publish it to the Jenkins Plugin Repository.

Note that this is a general overview of the plugin development process for Jenkins. Depending on your specific plugin, there may be additional steps or requirements. Be sure to consult the Jenkins Plugin Development Guide and other documentation for more detailed information.

Here is the link to the plugin development documentation page: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/

Hope this is useful üôÇ
14/03/2023, 15:44:28 - Jmm: Interesting point smilingprogrammer (Oyewale Abdulsobur) 
What kind of items are you thinking of? It might be the default/implied values. Often the export dumps the default values of parameters that are not explicitely defined. 
They should be flagged as potential drift and the user should be encouraged to define these values in his initial/reference config.
14/03/2023, 16:07:49 - srmalkan: So jenkins dumps lots of default values, asking users to include those attributes could affect the users experience.

What I had in my mind was to create a similiar yaml file by running the configuration in dry run mode, but i see every configurator has its own implementation to configure those attribute. so it gets complicated quickly.

 Another approach is to store the snapshot of the configurations.So in future we can use this snapshot as reference to detect drift.

What do think about this approach Jmm ?
14/03/2023, 16:23:23 - Jmm: " jenkins asking" is a little too far stretched. I'd say, it is a good practice to specify values otherwise defined as default. So it is the drift tool that should nudge the user by saying that it might be a default value.
14/03/2023, 16:24:15 - Jmm: Are you able to join the Office Hours of next Thursday? It would be easier for me to clarify.
14/03/2023, 16:27:29 - Jmm: in a nutshell, the way JCasC is used is that create the configuration file (sometimes based on an existing instance), you apply the configuration YAML file and store it in SCM. If you need to update a value, you submit a PR in the YAML, have it validated by a peer and that apply it to the instance. So the reference configuration (source of truth) is the YAML stored in SCM.
14/03/2023, 16:28:45 - Jmm: the purpose of the tool is to validate, before changing something in the config YAML file, that the assumption that it is still reflecting reality is true (that it didn't drift) 
14/03/2023, 16:28:50 - Jmm: does it make sense ?
14/03/2023, 16:37:40 - srmalkan: Jmm:  I will do join coming Thursday's Office hour. Yes I get your point

14/03/2023, 16:44:27 - Jmm: üëÄ
14/03/2023, 16:47:52 - Jmm: This is exactly what I was pointing at: All these values are default ones (they are most as false or disabled.
We need to find a way to handle these defaults elegantly
14/03/2023, 16:48:11 - Jmm: I have a couple of ideas about that
14/03/2023, 16:52:17 - Jmm: basically, for the most comnon   plugins or parameter group, learn (programatically?) what the defaults are. 
Or as you hinted to, give the option to dump a properly filled configuration snapshot. But then we would have two reference configuration: machine generated and humanly maintained
14/03/2023, 16:54:06 - Jmm: The way I proceeded was that I would configure the system by hand via the UI, dump the JCasC config, tweak it to make it work (ex: secrets), and then start maintaining that machine generated JCasC config by hand.

15/03/2023, 00:54:52 - Kris Stern: I don't think you will need to state all the steps but for all the phases maybe yes. This is because when writing the proposal you should already have a rough idea about how the project will be implemented, though not all the details. 
15/03/2023, 06:44:26 - srmalkan: Hi Jmm 

I have made one more observation in JCasC is that removing keys in yaml doesn't necessarily means the configuration will be removed.

This issue describes more about it : 
https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts/issues/430 

This indicates detecting delta doesn't means Jenkins will incorporate those changes.

Any thoughts on this ?

16/03/2023, 17:33:16 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): I have a question related to Proposal Reviews.
I have posted my [draft](https://community.jenkins.io/t/exponential-backoff-and-jitter-for-agent-reconnection-gsoc-2023-draft-proposal/6125) on this gitter channel and [community.jenkins.io](https://community.jenkins.io/t/exponential-backoff-and-jitter-for-agent-reconnection-gsoc-2023-draft-proposal/6125). Many mentors and fellow members of the channel have reviewed my proposal and i have improved it according to the reviews but I was hoping to hear something from the lead mentor of [Exponential Backoff and jitter for agent reconnection](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/agent_reconnections_exponential_backoff/) Basil crow as he's the one who proposed the idea. I believe he's currently occupied with something but a review from him would be beneficial for me so i can strengthen my proposal.
16/03/2023, 17:36:39 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Jmm: I would also love to get my proposal reviewed by the lead mentor. Currently only Kris and Mark have reviewed it.

16/03/2023, 17:42:07 - Jmm: I can understand your enthusiasm and eagerness to have your draft reviewed. But you also need to understand that mentors have other (professional) duties and obligations. I thus recommend patience and understanding.

1. `getPlugins()` in `CliOptions.java` is where the plugins are read from the CLI.
2. This was done by Verbosing out a message. All the details of this experiment are included in [this](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/pull/548) PR.

**What I have to do**

1. See if there is a `.hpi` file passes as an argument.
2. If Yes , handle that.

I am almost done with my proposal for the 'Docker Based Jenkins QuickStart Examples Project'.

I would like to request the 3rd iteration of proposal review from the mentors and the org admins.

I would also love to hear suggestions from other GSOC applicants and the Jenkins community in general as well!

Thank you very much for taking the time to review my proposal and giving feedback !

Please Note : 

I may get  "Anonymous : Made a Suggestion" on my side. 

This might be due to either the commenter not being logged into their account or usage of Incognito mode

I really appreciate the effort and time taken for the review, hence, I would just like to request double checking of the same in case of making a suggestion

Thank You! üòÅ

I sincerely request you to review my proposal and give me your comments. I will make modifications according to your suggestions. I hope I can submit an excellent proposal before the deadline.

20/03/2023, 08:50:00 - sloent: This is the first time for me to apply for GSoC.  My school welcomes private chat teachers to ask questions to show their enthusiasm, which is different from the rule that private chat is not allowed here.  I understand that the private chat will affect the fairness, but the original intention of my private chat is just to remind you that I have submitted the project without asking about the details.  I am very sorry for the trouble caused to you.  May I ask if teacher JMM is still willing to give me the opportunity to apply for this project?  If not, I have to give up.üò≠üò≠

22/03/2023, 17:41:42 - Kris Stern: Please check out this post for an important announcement affecting three of the 2023 project ideas
22/03/2023, 18:13:48 - dipanshu: I was very excited to for "Displaying the Plugin Health Scores" but sadly it withdrew. Nonetheless I'll into other projects and draft a proposal for it. 
22/03/2023, 18:16:29 - dipanshu: Just a question, 
I did the whole research and drafted a proposal for the project. 

So, could I start contributing regardless of not being in GSoC ?
22/03/2023, 18:42:27 - Kris Stern: I don't think we will have the capacity for that during the summer, and the project idea may be reserved for next year. So I would advise to refrain from working on it at least at the moment. 
22/03/2023, 18:54:50 - S.S.Akhilesh Appala: Thank you yuvichh  and Kris Stern. Happy to join the community.
22/03/2023, 19:11:32 - Jmm: The research you did is not lost and is valued. It helped you learn and acquire new skills. Don't let them get wasted. By leveraging your work and contribute, you will continue to progress and contribute back to the Community. These decisions are not easy on both ends. But they are part of life and should help us to grow.
23/03/2023, 04:30:23 - DollyLiu5021 (DollyLiu5021): Kris Stern: MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) Hi mentors, I added the scratch goal and gave update to the content. plz give another review once you are available. Thanks
23/03/2023, 04:49:11 - yuvichh: I was about to submit a draft proposal on J-Casc drift detector. Unfortunately it was removed.
23/03/2023, 04:55:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I disagree with Kris on this one.  You are welcome to contribute your efforts to the project, especially when there is no lead mentor available.  The maintainer of the plugin site (Gavin Mogan) has been willing to review pull requests that are done with effort to assure they are workable.  Please don't submit pull that you have not tested yourself, but good pull requests are very interesting to him.  Likewise, the documentation site has reviewers in Jean-Marc and in me.
23/03/2023, 08:54:11 - dipanshu: Thank You MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) Jmm Kris Stern for all your kind words and valuable insights. 
Though the project withdrew, but it helped me learn lot of things and give a lot of insights and experience in Jenkins and Open Source overall. 

I do agree with MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) . I still believe that this project would make the life of whole community a lot easier. 
So, I'll continue contributing towards this project.
Thank you everyone.
23/03/2023, 09:00:56 - Kris Stern: Yes, contribution is welcome on the relevant repositories. But please do not expect the same level of priority or attention that would be given to the regular GSoC project proposals selected, or the same level of mentorship to be provided. If you will already have been chosen to work on one GSoC project idea, it would be recommended to work on that primarily. 
23/03/2023, 09:15:36 - Kris Stern: Also I felt compelled to say this: Usually for a GSoC project extra effort is made by the team of mentors to handle the coordination and planning that makes a project successful. Without this for the "Displaying the Plugin Health Scores", it would be more difficult to bring the project into fruition by the code contributor not participating in GSoC alone. 
23/03/2023, 10:07:05 - Kris Stern: dipanshu: In other words, this will not be the same as an unpaid GSoC project. And, we expect you to respect the limited resources (most importantly time) the mentors of the originally two Plugin Health Score related projects have, and refrain from over-burdening them if the "Add probes to Plugin Health Score" project idea do get selected for GSoC 2023. Our contributors' and mentors' well-being is important to us and the community as well, and that was the reason why the project idea has been withdrawn in the first place. If we have had the resources the two projects would have gone ahead as planned. 
23/03/2023, 10:30:21 - Jmm: I recognise that today's GSoC Office Hours will be a very important session to answer questions, clarify the situation, and give guidance for the next steps.
Because of important family responsibilities, there is only a 15% likelihood that I will make in on time (I don't control doctors and trafic). Kris Stern, Mark Waite, and Alyssa Tong will lead the meeting in my absence. 
It stresses and frustrates me a lot not be present for this important meeting: GSoC and the human side of it is very important to me.

I have some questions

1- Does the impelementation should create a new repo, one for content, and one for antora-playbook, and another one for blogs?

can we have a monorepo, doing that, after some digging, I found that's is possible, and there's another way to generate the antora site, and a bunch of ways customize the UI
27/03/2023, 05:03:17 - Mahmoud Galal: 2- Also can we consider a client-side search instead of using Algolia, it's make more sense since we already has the data served staticlly 
27/03/2023, 05:03:45 - Kris Stern: We will have a new branch within a single repo
27/03/2023, 05:03:48 - Mahmoud Galal: 3- can our implementation be just modifing on the same repo, and then we can migrate it
27/03/2023, 05:04:11 - Kris Stern: No, we will not consider using client-side search instead of using Algolia
27/03/2023, 05:04:13 - Mahmoud Galal: which is the Jenkins.io repo, right ?
27/03/2023, 05:04:55 - Kris Stern: This project is more for the part before the migration, so any contributor working on the project need not worry about that
27/03/2023, 05:05:08 - Mahmoud Galal: okay, no problem, I'm just making sure I will follow the standars, while I'm creating my proposal
27/03/2023, 05:05:13 - Kris Stern: Eventually it should be
27/03/2023, 05:06:42 - Mahmoud Galal: so final question,

customizing the UI, implementing the search, and building the blog site with search

and refactor the adoc file is our fouces only with a CI automation
27/03/2023, 05:06:43 - Mahmoud Galal: right ?
27/03/2023, 05:08:23 - Kris Stern: I am not sure what you mean by refactor the adoc file, but likely we will need to convert the AsciiDocs at some point or reformat the existing ones. 
27/03/2023, 05:08:23 - Mahmoud Galal: okay It's must to follow the approach of creating antora-playbook, there's another way to generate the site, and also there's a way to have the content within the same repo, and it can be versioned easliy
27/03/2023, 05:09:09 - Kris Stern: The thing is that I am guessing you can have different directories with in the same repo

27/03/2023, 05:09:42 - Kris Stern: That's called formatting
27/03/2023, 05:10:23 - Mahmoud Galal: <@krisstern:matrix.org "The thing is that I am guessing ..."> we can do versioning with the same repo, by tags, or branches or directories
27/03/2023, 05:10:55 - Kris Stern: It depends on the implementation to be stated in your proposal
27/03/2023, 05:11:03 - Mahmoud Galal: so if we followed a monorepo approach, that we have one repo holds content and ui, and generator
27/03/2023, 05:11:41 - Kris Stern: True, that is one possibility
27/03/2023, 05:11:55 - Mahmoud Galal: we could do versioning by just branching the monorepo to tags, and changing the antora.yaml version
27/03/2023, 05:12:27 - Mahmoud Galal: so, I'm asking is there's a prefered approach to tickle it more and be more awear of it
27/03/2023, 05:12:50 - Mahmoud Galal: and I'm sorry for this noiseüòÄ
27/03/2023, 05:12:56 - Kris Stern: You should stick to the current approach as much as possible
27/03/2023, 05:13:03 - Mahmoud Galal: <@krisstern:matrix.org "That's called formatting"> I got it, thanks
27/03/2023, 05:14:04 - Mahmoud Galal: <@krisstern:matrix.org "You should stick to the current ..."> which is the one in the antora doc, that we separate the content alone
27/03/2023, 05:14:28 - Kris Stern: But all should still be done within one repo
27/03/2023, 05:15:43 - Mahmoud Galal: if we followed that approach it will be good, as we can put those implementation into the main repo Jenkins.io
27/03/2023, 05:16:11 - Mahmoud Galal: without creating any additional things, and the old part of the website will remain 
27/03/2023, 05:17:17 - Mahmoud Galal: and we will have a monorepo for the Jenkins.io which i see it's a good approach to follow
27/03/2023, 05:19:51 - Mahmoud Galal: Did you got me?
27/03/2023, 05:20:48 - Kris Stern: We are not yet at the stage where a proposal has been accepted for the project, that discussion will be left until then
27/03/2023, 05:22:12 - Mahmoud Galal: Okay, so I will add all these information, the many approaches we could follow

and I will mention you again
27/03/2023, 05:22:39 - Mahmoud Galal: Thanks for your time and effort really apprciated

27/03/2023, 09:24:36 - Kris Stern: Hi Kunal Kumar Thanks for sharing your draft proposal, but it seems you have not chosen any one of the project ideas we have on offer: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/

Without a proper project idea chosen it would be hard to define a clear direction and focus for your proposal. Also, in order for your proposal to be seriously considered, it will have to be a lot more developed than it currently is.

28/03/2023, 09:26:10 - Kris Stern: I am thinking the optimal number of pages would be something between 10 and 20, with a font-size of 11/12 or the normal text.

large or medium ?? 
28/03/2023, 11:03:36 - Kris Stern: It's of medium size
28/03/2023, 11:03:57 - AYUSH: Kris Stern: ok
28/03/2023, 13:04:57 - dhruvithakkar210: Greetings of the day mentors Kris Stern iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh) Jmm MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) ! Last week I was not well so haven't done any changes but tonight I will improve my proposal for building Jenkins with other tool . Kris Stern  when you reviewed my proposal you told me Blue Ocean will not receive further functionality updates.      So can we  use Jenkins X  ?
28/03/2023, 15:59:08 - Saarthak Maini: Thank you for the feedback! 
I wanted to give as much detail and context as possible in my proposal. I have also suggested multiple ways to achieve the project deliverables along with the desired code snippets. Some of the pages have also been used in listing out all of my contributions and work experience. That's the reason my proposal is long.
It might take a while to go through the proposal in detail , but I think this would be good in the long run as it is better to clear up any misinterpretations now , rather than after getting selected to the program
28/03/2023, 16:06:02 - Jmm: Blue Ocean is mainly a pipeline visualisation and management interface. It is currently "frozen" mainly because it was very "expensive" to maintain and in run ressources. The community is working on a very promising replacement.
JenkinsX can be viewed as a completely "different" build tool that massively leverages Kubernetes.

I fear that I didn't not correctly answered your question because I did not understand correctly its scope.
Could you please clarify your question? 
28/03/2023, 16:14:06 - Sonali-Rajput (Sonali): I have seen my ideas which I have came up with has been used by other participants and also been implemented when the GSoC has not even started yet, I can even point it out how exactly same it is. Is it fair to do that? Does it not against GSoC guidelines which is mentioned [on the GSoC rules page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules#:~:text=from%20the%20Program.-,Program%20Removal,-.%20In%20addition%20to) in the section 3.5 (g) (i) .

I have since taken the past 1 week to look into a project that I would be passionate about and would love to be a part of as a contributor.

29/03/2023, 13:51:26 - Kris Stern: I may be one of the mentors for the project also as we have some internal changes proposed, as also because I have recently adopted the Jenkins GitLab Plugin. But I will definitely give your proposal a review tonight Asia time. 
29/03/2023, 14:08:12 - Kris Stern: Done
29/03/2023, 16:25:06 - Kris Stern: But you may need to build first with either `npm run build` or `npm run build:watch`. 
29/03/2023, 16:26:11 - Kris Stern: Just in case you are not familiar with the workflow, before doing everything else, every time you start, you should run `npm i` to install the dependencies. 
29/03/2023, 16:30:59 - Kris Stern: Agree with JMM's observation. But I think you may not need Blue Ocean or a replacement for this project idea at all. 
29/03/2023, 16:48:04 - Kris Stern: We will follow up and do some investigation to the level of plagiarisms we have observed for this particular project idea. But beware that this rule applies to everyone. We will rely on the draft proposals with time of reception to establish a timeline to see who is likely to have copied whom. 
29/03/2023, 17:41:18 - Kris Stern: Hi vayuusaee! Welcome to the Jenkins community.

29/03/2023, 22:17:30 - Mahmoud Galal: Kris Stern Jmm 

when should I extend the evaluation phase 

I will be having exams during June so I will be working but with less time around 25-30
so I can extend my evaluation phase here right ?
29/03/2023, 22:20:39 - Jmm: What do you mean exactly with "evaluation phase" Mahmoud Galal ? 
There is no problem that you state in your proposal that for that given period you will not be available. Mentors might also not be available during some periods.
29/03/2023, 23:05:26 - Mahmoud Galal: I have just one issue during the timeline which is the start with  1-3 June and will end 28 June those my final exams, after that I will be totally commitiment to the timeline
So I did state them but during creating my proposed time within the Coding period, I will decress the work time to 20-30 hours as I mentioned

so if I want to extend the evaluation of the code, should I mention that in the proposal or I can do that during a meeting or smth like this ? 
30/03/2023, 00:51:58 - Kris Stern: The evaluation periods cannot be changed as these are set by Google for GSoC and mentors are required to submit assessments during such periods. 
30/03/2023, 00:52:47 - Kris Stern: Please do consider including details of your issue in the proposal to be submitted. 
30/03/2023, 00:53:28 - Mahmoud Galal: I don't want to change them I just wanted to know that we could use them, like its mentioned that we can deliver the assessments or we can extend them, so I'm asking about how I can ask for this extending
30/03/2023, 00:54:07 - Kris Stern: I mean we cannot extend the periods, that's what I meant. 
30/03/2023, 00:54:37 - Kris Stern: If by extending you mean not changing then it does not make much sense to me. 
30/03/2023, 00:55:14 - Kris Stern: In other words, you cannot ask for "this" to be extended. 
30/03/2023, 00:58:34 - Mahmoud Galal: okay, thanks Kris Stern 
I would like to look again on my proposal, I think you are there

but I want you to foucs on the part of the migrating to Antora and gatsby
and the proposed timeline
to make sure I did them in the right way
30/03/2023, 02:33:19 - Kris Stern: I do not think it is a good practice to ask me to "make sure" you write any part of the proposal in "the right way", so I will refrain from doing that. In fact, we do not do that for any particular proposal. But you do have the liberty to exercise your creativity to come up with a way of presentation that is pleasing and accurate to you. 
30/03/2023, 05:58:02 - Mahmoud Galal: Okay, my bad I'm sorry

30/03/2023, 06:00:25 - Mahmoud Galal: Hello Kris Stern MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) Jmm iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh) 

I have finished the final draft of my proposal, I put all the missed parts that I wasn't completed them yet

so I would like to hear back from you

31/03/2023, 03:14:58 - SHAIK MAHAMMAD ASHRAF: Hello everyone  , Iam new joinee to community I just saw the idea building apps using android development.  I want to work as contributor for these project as part of gsoc program.  Mentors help me out.  I don't know much about in these community.  So mentors please give right enter into these program. Thank you. Waiting for your reply. 
31/03/2023, 03:27:19 - SHAIK MAHAMMAD ASHRAF: hello Kris stern , I want to be part of gsoc contributor.  I really excited when I saw apps building using android development, Java docker. So I want a guide to drag me into these program. What can I do prove to be part of these contribution. 
31/03/2023, 03:28:10 - Kris Stern: Yes
31/03/2023, 03:33:00 - SHAIK MAHAMMAD ASHRAF: I have basic knowledge on Java and android development.i done a project to build a apk file using android studio on basic need to my shop. But due to less guidance I cant make it happen .But my app is build with a good reactive based used tools fire base to run database.                        Project name:A1FASHIONS ,languageused:java.                                                Ide:android studio. Database :firebase.                           On period of:2020-6-3.  But I came up nice but it has issues no security development and crash down with high usage and stop down that.    
31/03/2023, 03:45:24 - Kris Stern: Hi SHAIK MAHAMMAD ASHRAF The best thing you can do now is to start preparing for a project proposal for https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/buiilding-android-app/. For more info about how to prepare for an application, please see https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/. The lead mentor is currently Bruno, and he is more actively on https://community.jenkins.io/tag/gsoc. 
31/03/2023, 03:47:34 - Kris Stern: So I would suggest you to try and come up with a draft proposal for review before end of Sunday and post it on https://community.jenkins.io/tag/gsoc, tagging Bruno at https://community.jenkins.io/u/poddingue/summary for review, as we will not be reviewing drafts after Sunday. 
31/03/2023, 03:49:01 - SHAIK MAHAMMAD ASHRAF: Yes I have no great ideas but I want to work and learn with people who are great at doing things, any other ways do you have can I do for you. Or else if proposal is mandatory means I will try for it
31/03/2023, 03:52:24 - Kris Stern: Proposals are mandatory, and they should be submitted via https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ for your application to be considered.

31/03/2023, 03:58:28 - Kris Stern: We also take into consideration any previous involvement with the community especially just before application period, like code contributions via pull requests, and any positive feedback of the interactions. 
31/03/2023, 03:59:53 - SHAIK MAHAMMAD ASHRAF: Yes I don't have any previous contributions then I how to manage this out. I can start now to code contribute any code. 
31/03/2023, 04:00:53 - Kris Stern: Maybe you can take a look at this: https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/
31/03/2023, 04:03:17 - SHAIK MAHAMMAD ASHRAF: Kk thanks for your time Kris stern, proposal should be submit here and gsoc in both .am I right or else here only you help me out to review my propasal
31/03/2023, 04:04:48 - Kris Stern: You need to submit your proposal via the Google Summer of Code website. But you can post it here or to community.jenkins.io as I have described for a review. The lead mentor is not actively monitoring this channel so you better tag him there. 
31/03/2023, 04:06:03 - SHAIK MAHAMMAD ASHRAF: Okay that's great thanks 
31/03/2023, 04:06:16 - Kris Stern: You are welcome

31/03/2023, 18:03:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I personally think that posting a project proposal from ChatGPT is a waste of time and damages your credibility.  I've scanned your proposal and would immediately discard it as overly broad, lacking details, lacking any interactions with others in the Jenkins project, and lacking a lead mentor to support it.  You didn't follow the guidelines from the Jenkins project and didn't understand the expectation that project ideas need to have a lead mentor for success.  Without a lead mentor, the Jenkins project is unlikely to consider your project.
31/03/2023, 18:16:03 - shaiekashu0000: Okay I followed all Jenkins guidelines and I started working to integrate two domains that's all , I just taken format to publish my content not whole idea. Here the great thing we are choosing big data which works on integrating, processing and making data into structured form. Jenkins is tool which is which works on ci/cd helps to automated cleaning the data. 
31/03/2023, 18:23:19 - Jmm: Hello shaiekashu0000 
Thank you for investing in this and sharing it with us. I have just two comments: 
- if you are expectiing comments and advise on your proposal, it is best to provide the link to a Google Document so that we can more easily share our  comments.
Note that we are already late in the timeline and mentors will have very little time to read it (and will deal first with proposals that were earlier in the queue)
- second comment is that, as you are probably aware, that we have a limited number mentors.
31/03/2023, 18:24:09 - Jmm: And a good point to have mentioned upfront that you used ChatGPT to help you in composing your proposal
31/03/2023, 18:24:22 - shaiekashu0000: Okay I followed all Jenkins guidelines and I started working to integrate two domains that's all , I just taken format to publish my content not whole idea.

31/03/2023, 18:33:18 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I'm not disputing that Jenkins and big data might be an interesting combination for a future project.  We've even had a project idea proposed in 2020 for Jenkins and Machine Learning Plugins for Data Science . We have no current lead mentor that is willing to mentor such a project.  If you're interested in data science and Jenkins, you're encouraged to read https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/project-ideas/machine-learning/
31/03/2023, 18:34:01 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I won't spend further time reviewing your proposal.  Other proposals are more interesting to me because they are on topics where I am interested

31/03/2023, 19:55:11 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I'm sorry, but I can't give personal coaching at this stage of Google Summer of Code.  There are 20+ other proposals that I need to review.  Those proposals were submitted before yours.  Those proposals are related to ideas that I find interesting.  Those proposals have a lead mentor that is willing to work on them.  In a week or two I may be able to provide that type of guidance, but not now.
31/03/2023, 20:24:36 - Mahmoud Galal: Hello Jmm Kris Stern MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh) 

Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools considerd as a Large project in case I will do the 3 milestones

is that right ?
31/03/2023, 20:33:29 - Kris Stern: Not necessarily, the size actually is dependent upon the scope of the project proposal 
31/03/2023, 20:34:10 - Mahmoud Galal: so I'm sending it to google, and the ask for the size

I picked the Large, cuz I will do the 3 milestones 
31/03/2023, 21:34:55 - Jmm: I second Mark's review and comments.
01/04/2023, 03:42:09 - Kris Stern: Hi hemanth Your best shot is to prepare for a proposal for this project using our template and submit it to Google via https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/. The proposal and application preparation guidelines are at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/. 
01/04/2023, 03:43:19 - Kris Stern: Hi Shaik Tahseen You will need to apply formally and include all the details in your proposal to be submitted via https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ for your application to be considered. 
01/04/2023, 03:44:23 - Kris Stern: I have requested access to comment on your work as a org admin

01/04/2023, 13:21:28 - Kris Stern: We will carefully assess the scope of each submitted proposal to see if the size proposed matches the scope. It is not directly linked to how many milestones are included necessarily.

Otherwise we cannot review. 
01/04/2023, 15:14:17 - Kris Stern: I cannot comment to review currently.

01/04/2023, 15:43:27 - Kris Stern: You will need to do a lot more research and present your findings to add to it

03/04/2023, 02:23:58 - Kris Stern: The deadline for review requests has passed 
03/04/2023, 02:39:53 - Kris Stern: Mahmoud Galal: I noticed you copied exactly the same words in your proposal from Vandit Singh's proposal. This may impact your chances to be selected.
03/04/2023, 03:22:00 - Kris Stern: I would advise paraphrasing instead of copying. That way it would not be considered plagiarism. 
03/04/2023, 03:56:19 - Mahmoud Galal: I didn't do smth like that ?
as mentioned in the office hours we could take ideas and create more deep ideas from our prescriptive 

and that what i do, like how could we change concepts

Like creating, deploying, restructuring ?!
I have never copied smth from others I was looking for their proposal to know how they got the idea  
03/04/2023, 03:56:43 - Mahmoud Galal: to come up with better one, in a way to stand-out 
03/04/2023, 03:56:50 - Kris Stern: I understand we could borrow ideas, but not to copy as is
03/04/2023, 03:57:08 - Mahmoud Galal: mention where did I copy ideas ?
03/04/2023, 03:57:16 - Mahmoud Galal: comment in my proposal 
03/04/2023, 03:57:25 - Mukund B Srinivas: Whats the fitter channel to discuss non GSoC contributing 
03/04/2023, 03:57:28 - Kris Stern: Check your table of contents, please, the wordings are suspiciously looking the same
03/04/2023, 03:57:57 - Mukund B Srinivas: Like I'd still like to contribute 
03/04/2023, 03:57:58 - Kris Stern: I am not commenting on your proposal at this stage
03/04/2023, 03:58:15 - Kris Stern: Mukund B Srinivas: Please start a new thread
03/04/2023, 03:58:23 - Mahmoud Galal: yeah, I did that in a point of knowing how, that's it cuz I don't know how to make it properly  but the content is tootally different 
03/04/2023, 03:58:46 - Kris Stern: <@mahmoudgalalz:gitter.im "mention where did I copy ideas ?"> You obviously borrowed ideas, I did not say copy ideas.
03/04/2023, 03:59:11 - Mahmoud Galal: so it's wrong to know how to make a table of content ?!!!
03/04/2023, 03:59:20 - Kris Stern: <@mahmoudgalalz:gitter.im "yeah, I did that in a point of k..."> Just update your proposal so the wordings are different
03/04/2023, 03:59:35 - Mahmoud Galal: like my table is not the exact same 
03/04/2023, 03:59:38 - Mahmoud Galal: just some parts 
03/04/2023, 03:59:40 - Mahmoud Galal: okay
03/04/2023, 03:59:46 - Kris Stern: You copied the wordings in the table of contents, they should not be
03/04/2023, 03:59:48 - Mahmoud Galal: could you please help me out 
03/04/2023, 04:00:14 - Mahmoud Galal: I understand, but the content is really different
03/04/2023, 04:00:21 - Kris Stern: You have been asking for too much it seems, more than any other potential contributors. That does not seems like a fair request.
03/04/2023, 04:00:50 - Kris Stern: The wordings in the contents are exactly the same, but the ordering is different. 
03/04/2023, 04:01:01 - Mahmoud Galal: I was doing that as he follow that right we from the proposal sample provided by the Org
03/04/2023, 04:01:29 - Mahmoud Galal: so I just want to be clear,  I'm sorry for asking a lot
03/04/2023, 04:01:51 - Mahmoud Galal: does you see any thing except the table of content ?
03/04/2023, 04:01:57 - Kris Stern: Other proposals on the same project idea do not have this problem though
03/04/2023, 04:02:11 - Mahmoud Galal: like the table of content only having the same word 
03/04/2023, 04:02:31 - Kris Stern: But that is still plagiarism. 
03/04/2023, 04:02:46 - Mahmoud Galal: I have another way to propose my idea not similar to anyone 
03/04/2023, 04:02:47 - Kris Stern: The similarities are too striking
03/04/2023, 04:03:13 - Kris Stern: Copying word for word is what I mean by plagiarism. 
03/04/2023, 04:03:19 - Mahmoud Galal: in the table of content only, right ?
03/04/2023, 04:04:31 - Mahmoud Galal: I did not copy, btw but maybe I used the same name but the headers are more and different, maybe there's same names, but that doesn't mean I did copy the content though 
03/04/2023, 04:05:09 - Kris Stern: You clearly had studies Vandit's proposal and borrowed idea. It looks like copying to me. 
03/04/2023, 04:05:28 - Kris Stern: Don't try to explain anything. Just fix it. 
03/04/2023, 04:05:34 - Mahmoud Galal: you kinda of make me look bad, but I swear I didn't copy content and I have never used them, I studied all the proposals 
03/04/2023, 04:05:56 - Kris Stern: Please be careful of your attitude
03/04/2023, 04:06:01 - Kris Stern: You are accusing me of lying
03/04/2023, 04:06:12 - Mahmoud Galal: in way to stand out and come up with a better idea, even to improve mine 
03/04/2023, 04:06:38 - Mahmoud Galal: I don't do that, I mean you are trying to make my like I stole other peoples idea
03/04/2023, 04:06:47 - Mahmoud Galal: and also I'm sorry
03/04/2023, 04:06:55 - Kris Stern: But your words are exactly the same as Vandit's
03/04/2023, 04:06:56 - Mahmoud Galal: I will do the right thing
03/04/2023, 04:07:02 - Kris Stern: Just fix it
03/04/2023, 04:07:29 - Mahmoud Galal: maybe the table of content yeah I do agree with that
03/04/2023, 04:07:35 - Kris Stern: I know
03/04/2023, 04:07:39 - Mahmoud Galal: but the ideas aren't the same 
03/04/2023, 04:08:03 - Kris Stern: I did not say you copied ideas. I have said this many times.
03/04/2023, 04:08:06 - Mahmoud Galal: also maybe I used some words cuz they are descriptive than mine but not the idea
03/04/2023, 04:08:18 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm sorry for bad understanding you
03/04/2023, 04:08:24 - Kris Stern: In fact it is perfectly fine to have similar ideas
03/04/2023, 04:08:50 - Mahmoud Galal: I tried my best to understand the ideas all over 
03/04/2023, 04:08:58 - Mahmoud Galal: and try to come up with better one
03/04/2023, 04:09:05 - Mahmoud Galal: and I did
03/04/2023, 04:09:34 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm sorry for taking to much of your time
03/04/2023, 04:09:42 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm really sorry for that
03/04/2023, 04:09:54 - Mahmoud Galal: and I will do the required things 
03/04/2023, 04:10:23 - Mahmoud Galal: but I will ask you to look back, sorry for the noises that I brings to you
03/04/2023, 04:10:32 - Mahmoud Galal: thanks Kris Stern 
03/04/2023, 04:10:56 - Kris Stern: Google may be looking at the proposals too
03/04/2023, 04:11:14 - Kris Stern: Hence the request for change in case they detect plagiarism
03/04/2023, 04:11:35 - Mahmoud Galal: I appreciate that, sorry for misunderstanding 
03/04/2023, 04:11:44 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm really sorry though 
03/04/2023, 04:34:36 - Mahmoud Galal: Hello Kris Stern , I just want to mention that he copied me not mee that copied him
03/04/2023, 04:34:57 - Kris Stern: I don't think so
03/04/2023, 04:34:59 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm the only person who discussed the monorepo approach 
03/04/2023, 04:35:10 - Kris Stern: He submitted his draft proposal first
03/04/2023, 04:35:15 - Mahmoud Galal: and he change his doc with that
03/04/2023, 04:35:22 - Mahmoud Galal: look for his new one

03/04/2023, 04:35:55 - Mahmoud Galal: image.png (Media omitted)
03/04/2023, 04:36:00 - Mahmoud Galal: I have never copied ideas 
03/04/2023, 04:36:14 - Kris Stern: As I said it is perfectly okay to borrow ideas as discussed during GSoC Office Hours. 
03/04/2023, 04:36:14 - Mahmoud Galal: I just used kind of words as my vocab is not that good
03/04/2023, 04:36:23 - Kris Stern: Still
03/04/2023, 04:36:37 - Mahmoud Galal: this has never discuessed in any of GSoc office hours
03/04/2023, 04:36:47 - Kris Stern: <@mahmoudgalalz:gitter.im "I'm the only person who discusse..."> He did mention it I think previously
03/04/2023, 04:37:09 - Mahmoud Galal: I asked for a meeting to propose this idea and Jmm told me that there's no time
03/04/2023, 04:37:19 - Kris Stern: Why the accusations now, I see people borrowing each other's ideas
03/04/2023, 04:37:24 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm the one you said that I studied all the proposals 
03/04/2023, 04:37:41 - Mahmoud Galal: okay I have no problem with him coping my idea 
03/04/2023, 04:37:49 - Kris Stern: <@mahmoudgalalz:gitter.im "I asked for a meeting to propose..."> That maybe too much to ask for. We already held a meeting before you started contributing. 
03/04/2023, 04:37:51 - Mahmoud Galal: I want the better for the org
03/04/2023, 04:38:07 - Mahmoud Galal: I attended two meeting 
03/04/2023, 04:38:15 - Jagruti: > this has never discuessed in any of GSoc office hours

It was in the last two GSoC meetings. Not sure about earlier ones. 
03/04/2023, 04:38:20 - Mahmoud Galal: there's was two or one that I didn't attend
03/04/2023, 04:38:36 - Mahmoud Galal: I attended that last two
03/04/2023, 04:38:41 - Kris Stern: We will start accessing proposals once the GSoC application closes. 
03/04/2023, 04:38:44 - Mahmoud Galal: you can see the doc file attendes 
03/04/2023, 04:39:18 - Mahmoud Galal: you just made me feel that I'm robber and I didn't do that
03/04/2023, 04:39:42 - Kris Stern: It's not the first time I see you getting defensive. 
03/04/2023, 04:39:53 - Kris Stern: I don't see why you are trying to blame people
03/04/2023, 04:40:03 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm not trying to do that
03/04/2023, 04:40:09 - Kris Stern: We do open-source, so there is a lot of collaboration 
03/04/2023, 04:40:27 - Jagruti: Kris isn't accusing you. She is just pointing out what the mentors and Google team will think. 
03/04/2023, 04:40:29 - Kris Stern: It is normal to make mistakes
03/04/2023, 04:40:40 - Mahmoud Galal: I do, even I told that I can help vandit 
03/04/2023, 04:40:49 - Kris Stern: Thanks Jagruti 
03/04/2023, 04:40:50 - Mahmoud Galal: and you said we cannot collaborate
03/04/2023, 04:40:59 - Kris Stern: <@mahmoudgalalz:gitter.im "I do, even I told that I can hel..."> You are not supposed to
03/04/2023, 04:41:06 - Mahmoud Galal: yeah I got this point 
03/04/2023, 04:41:12 - Kris Stern: GSoC projects are supposed to be solo projects
03/04/2023, 04:41:13 - Mahmoud Galal: and I didn't as you said 
03/04/2023, 04:41:29 - Mahmoud Galal: I follow what you are saying to me 
03/04/2023, 04:41:38 - Mahmoud Galal: as you are my mentor you know better than me
03/04/2023, 04:41:55 - Kris Stern: Don't over worry when there seems to be a problem. We should try to mitigate it, not to make things worse. 
03/04/2023, 04:42:14 - Mahmoud Galal: but I'm kinda feeling bad cuz you mentioned that I copied someone
03/04/2023, 04:42:19 - Jagruti: > I follow what you are saying to me 

There is still time. You can ask him and rephrase those parts of the proposal and increase your chances of selection. All the best
03/04/2023, 04:42:35 - Mahmoud Galal: and I'm trying to prove that I didn't
03/04/2023, 04:42:54 - Kris Stern: You don't need to prove anything
03/04/2023, 04:43:04 - Mahmoud Galal: but all the point that i'm focusing on it just to make the better for this org better 
03/04/2023, 04:43:12 - Kris Stern: You two borrowed ideas from each other
03/04/2023, 04:43:21 - Kris Stern: That is fine
03/04/2023, 04:43:42 - Mahmoud Galal: I just want to mention smth worried

03/04/2023, 04:43:58 - Kris Stern: Good
03/04/2023, 04:44:20 - Mahmoud Galal: and by the considance I looked for him and it was the same heading he did change them before me
03/04/2023, 04:44:34 - Mahmoud Galal: <@jagruti1:matrix.org "There is still time. You can ask..."> thanks I will
03/04/2023, 04:45:01 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm looking for his proposal right now to see if i'm using any of his words and try to remove it
03/04/2023, 04:45:09 - Kris Stern: Good
03/04/2023, 04:45:18 - Mahmoud Galal: our tables are so different rn 
03/04/2023, 04:45:21 - Kris Stern: Just need rephrasing
03/04/2023, 04:45:33 - Mahmoud Galal: like there's no word look like the other one 
03/04/2023, 04:45:42 - Mahmoud Galal: before I start to do that
03/04/2023, 04:45:45 - Kris Stern: Perfect
03/04/2023, 04:45:55 - Mahmoud Galal: so I don't see any words similar 
03/04/2023, 04:46:07 - Mahmoud Galal: but I will doing the best 
03/04/2023, 04:46:18 - Mahmoud Galal: and I will adding another section that I missed

03/04/2023, 04:46:48 - Mahmoud Galal: and i'm sorry for my bad descriptive words 
03/04/2023, 04:47:00 - Mahmoud Galal: I hope you didn't get me wrong 
03/04/2023, 04:47:19 - Kris Stern: Maybe I should say this too, we look for behavioural qualities in a candidate as well, not just technical 
03/04/2023, 04:47:46 - Mahmoud Galal: I do, that why I'm trying to help you understand me well
03/04/2023, 04:48:10 - Kris Stern: But be careful of the things you say and ask for
03/04/2023, 04:48:41 - Kris Stern: Because once you have said it you cannot take it back
03/04/2023, 04:48:59 - Kris Stern: I don't mean just on Gitter
03/04/2023, 04:49:43 - Mahmoud Galal: even I have not been selected I will still contributor to Jenkins, cuz I got familiar with it, and it will be great if this project finished well I will have a better chance for more contributions as well, cuz I know how this project work  
03/04/2023, 04:50:01 - Kris Stern: Sure
03/04/2023, 04:50:17 - Mahmoud Galal: I'm sorry, I'm trying my best to chose the better words

03/04/2023, 07:20:37 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): I would like to highlight that this diagram is only thing i have added later on. I have mentioned That

**we can also use monorepo and we can go with seperate repository**

My proposal already had all the approaches and i either removed the approaches mentors said this will not work.

I have wrote in later sections to implement versioning only in specific component it would be correct to use components as folder in antora.
I think you misunderstood it as copying.
03/04/2023, 07:34:07 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): However if we have same ideas. I'm completely okay with you saying that we **SHARED** each others ideas and not stealing ideas.

That is not very opensource friendly term.

03/04/2023, 07:40:51 - Jatinder Mahajan: I am preparing my project proposal will share asap

03/04/2023, 13:17:19 - Jagruti: Yes. It is loaded after refreshing a couple of times. 
03/04/2023, 13:23:12 - NotMyFault (Alexander Brandes): Same here if I use the browser. But looks all good when using the app, maybe try out the app version? https://element.io/download
03/04/2023, 13:51:18 - Sonali-Rajput (Sonali): Yes it is back to normal now, I had to reset.
03/04/2023, 13:53:54 - Sonali-Rajput (Sonali): <@vandit1604-63401d426da03739849d8b03:gitter.im "I'm facing the same issue after ..."> In the security & privacy option, I just reset the device for "where you're signed in". It solved the problem for me. You can try that out.

03/04/2023, 18:10:09 - Vinay Tiwari: hi everyone, i am new to this group ,anyway i have good working knowledge of kubernetes ,docker , go language, and java , previously i have build the api and  kubernetes client for various organisations,  i am very interested in this project and i believe that i have a proper knowledge and skills to  develop this project, so  i am in process of submitting my gsoc proposal. for this Docker-based Jenkins quickstart project...Thank you
03/04/2023, 18:14:19 - Jmm: Welcome Vinay Tiwari  and good luck with your proposal. Make sure that you use the template as described at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/#student-proposals
04/04/2023, 01:32:28 - Jatinder Mahajan: hi Kris Stern  gsoc website  is giving error : something went wrong while i am submitting my proposal 
please help me
04/04/2023, 01:36:54 - Mahmoud Galal: Hi Kris Stern 
I have completed what you did say to me so I'm asking to check again

and Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh) 

I'm kinda sorry for this, but I have to say that I didn't stole anyone's idea or implementations, maybe I used names and this wrong 

even when any proposal give me hints I searched and see the proof of doing that, and how I can come up with better implementation
 

the  most clearest example of software industry copying form OS software design as caching, concurrency etc.


04/04/2023, 01:38:18 - Mahmoud Galal: so again I'm sorry, and I hope we connect later to work together on other side-project as I like that so much, and you are a talented person
04/04/2023, 01:38:31 - Mahmoud Galal: and I'm sorry Kris Stern for the missunderstanding
04/04/2023, 01:38:39 - Mahmoud Galal: thanks so much for your help all the time
04/04/2023, 01:47:38 - Kris Stern: Mahmoud Galal: But the fact is that you did falsely accuse someone else of stealing your idea(s) and you also falsely accused me of making up the fact that you plagiarised other‚Äôs work. This is not fair to us, nor should such behaviour be condoned in open-source. Please pay attention I am not your peer, and am actually one of the org admins and potential mentors who are responsible for assessing every applicant‚Äôs case. 
04/04/2023, 01:54:19 - Kris Stern: What is the error message?
04/04/2023, 01:55:14 - Jatinder Mahajan: Screenshot (160).png (Media omitted)

04/04/2023, 01:55:55 - Kris Stern: Did you try refreshing the page?
04/04/2023, 01:56:03 - Jatinder Mahajan: many times
04/04/2023, 01:56:23 - Kris Stern: Did you sign out and sign back in again?
04/04/2023, 01:56:44 - Jatinder Mahajan: yes
04/04/2023, 01:57:05 - Mahmoud Galal: Kris Stern: I admit I did that, and I was missunderstanded the situation. You are not just an Org admin, you did a lot of effort with us, and we all should apprciate that

my apologies to what happend later 

I hope we are good and we don't feel anything bad to each other

hopfully to understand me and what I was trying to say 
04/04/2023, 01:57:49 - Kris Stern: Try opening a ticket with Google using the email address you are applying with, at gsoc-support@google.com. 
04/04/2023, 01:58:13 - Kris Stern: Do you use Chrome as the browser by the way?
04/04/2023, 01:59:10 - Kris Stern: <@krisstern:matrix.org "Try opening a ticket with Google..."> Remember to tell them what time and what went wrong with your application (e.g., cannot submit after filling out form). 
04/04/2023, 02:00:12 - Kris Stern: No worries, we will still assess all submitted applications in a systematic and fair manner. 
04/04/2023, 02:01:15 - Mahmoud Galal: I know, but I do not like that anyone feel bad personally
so again I apologies

04/04/2023, 02:02:36 - Kris Stern: I will not review anyone's proposal any more

I know most of the mentors were busy, only Kris Stern got a chance to review my proposal. 
So I created a small video to demonstrate the POC for `Screenshot Automation for Jenkins Docs`.
These won't take more than 10 mins üôÇ

05/04/2023, 07:18:17 - abhinav700 (abhinav700): Hey everyone,
 sorry i was inactive from last few days.
I was engaged in some college activities


I have completed watching the 5 videos by mark waite on modernizing a jenkins plugin.
i have also learnt basics of docker,jira,gitlab and gitpod.



Can someone please guide me how i can start with issues ? I wish to work on gitlab modernization project While examining the project description i cam across 2 links:

[Good first issues for plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue)

[organization wide newBie friendly issues](https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly%20)


which one should I start with and how?
05/04/2023, 07:27:19 - DollyLiu5021 (DollyLiu5021): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Hi everyone, we are nearing the ..."> Hi Kirs, I missed to submit official application with proposal since I just finished midterm one hour ago. May I ask if I can find any way to submit it?
05/04/2023, 08:49:08 - Kris Stern: I am sorry DollyLiu5021 (DollyLiu5021), we have received instructions from the GSoC organisers to reject any application submission extension request passed the original April 4th 18:00 UTC deadline. Your best chance is to try again next year if there will be another iteration of GSoC.
