10/04/2022, 16:09:38 - Jmm: Another very useful source of information are the notes and recording of the Jenkins GSoC office hours
10/04/2022, 16:10:23 - Jmm: Shoot chinemeze847 (chinemeze847) , while I am on line :-)
10/04/2022, 16:10:30 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): Ok sir am also on that too
10/04/2022, 16:11:41 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): sir am interested in the automatic spec generator for jenkins rest api, because the skills there meet what i can do but what if i have not used jenkins before
10/04/2022, 16:12:55 - Jmm: (no need to call me Sir: it makes me feel older than I am in fact  😉)
10/04/2022, 16:13:30 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): ok i take note of that
10/04/2022, 16:14:22 - Jmm: > am interested in the automatic spec generator for jenkins rest api

Sounds wise. It is an interesting project.
10/04/2022, 16:17:53 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): yeah it's an interesting project i just watched one of your office meetings explaining the project
10/04/2022, 16:19:22 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): but does it require prior knowledge to jenkins?
10/04/2022, 16:24:27 - Jmm: Understanding of Jenkins (especially the Rest API) will help you to build a strong proposal and increase your chances to be selected. I recommend to experiment with for exemple start a local instance (with docker).
10/04/2022, 16:26:05 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): ok thanks but am also considering the deadline for the proposal, the experimenting won't it extend the time because i was planning to write my proposal today
10/04/2022, 16:27:27 - Jmm: 👍️
10/04/2022, 16:29:54 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): so, sir according to what you are saying i should first experiment with jenkins by running a local container of it using docker and also have a good understanding of REST API before submitting my proposal.
10/04/2022, 16:33:57 - Jmm: The more you know and the better your proposal (impactful) the better your chances to be selected. There will be several proposal for the same project I fear.
10/04/2022, 16:36:21 - Jmm: Having experience with the Jenkins Community and how it works (understanding the submission process) are also plus points.
10/04/2022, 16:37:17 - Jmm: But don't worry, work on your proposal and make it the best you can: it is valuable experience.
10/04/2022, 16:38:05 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): Thank you very much i really appreciate your friendliness and quick response
10/04/2022, 16:38:46 - Jmm: If you're not selected this year, we will help you prepare for the next edition.
10/04/2022, 16:39:30 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): i believe i will be selected this year :)
10/04/2022, 16:46:46 - chinemeze847 (chinemeze847): Thanks

11/04/2022, 12:34:18 - AliMussawi (AliMussawi): thanks
11/04/2022, 12:40:00 - AbhyudayaSharma (Abhyudaya Sharma): @AliMussawi also see this excerpt from https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/ to better understand the student acceptance process

> Following the GSoC contributor application deadline, organizations begin reviewing the proposals they received. During the review phase, organizations maintain an open dialogue with their applicants. This may involve clarifying questions in regards to the final proposals to ensure applicants and organizations have the same understanding of the proposal. It is important to note an applicant’s proposal can’t be altered after the final submission deadline, and mentor organizations should not attempt to do so during the review period.
>
> Organizations may also conduct further interviews to determine which applicants are most likely to be a good fit for the community and work required. Over the course of several weeks, each organization prioritizes its list of proposals, ranking them and then submitting their requests for slots to Google. Google will let each organization know how many slots it will fund, and based on ranked order those proposals will be automatically selected (if given 5 slots, those proposals ranked 1-5 will be selected).

11/04/2022, 13:15:39 - pushker001 (pushker001): Automatic git cache maintenance on the controller  I have selected this project what know I have to do 
11/04/2022, 13:18:05 - Jmm: Hello pushker001 (pushker001) , welcome aboard.
A good start is to listen to the recordings of the Jenkins GSoC Office Hours. Many questions were asked and answered during these session.
11/04/2022, 13:18:09 - Dheeraj: @ADI10HERO Thanks very much for sharing the plugin health score calculating algorithm with me. I have one doubt/observation that I wanted to share with you (and everyone else)

As per the algo, if we pass unbounded discrete values via a "tanh" function, it will definitely bring our discrete value to a [-1,1] range but we might not be able to preserve some useful info. For example, I've noticed that the tanh function gives the value as "1" for both the (example) inputs "150" as well as "38825". 

So, even though both the values have a huge difference between them, both of them result in a common value "1" when passed through the tanh function. I believe, ideally, we would need to treat both values differently while calculating the health score.
11/04/2022, 13:19:19 - Jmm: Also, pushker001 (pushker001) , two brainstorm sessions on this project were organised. The recordings are available on-line.
11/04/2022, 13:19:35 - Jmm: Let me know if you have difficulties finding them.
11/04/2022, 13:19:47 - pushker001 (pushker001): yes provide me

Just a friendly reminder that the official application deadline is April 19th, so be sure to have a proposal submitted by that time for your application to be considered by Jenkins and Google. Also, confidential information like the number of slots Jenkins will be applying for and to be granted by Google is private and will not be disclosed by us. All the best with your applications!

12/04/2022, 17:33:29 - kuro: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "@ADI10HERO Thanks very much for ..."> Ah good catch dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha), now a simple "log" function is looking better XD
Nevertheless, I will put some more thought into this and update the same on the brain storming document, would that be fine?
12/04/2022, 17:33:55 - Dheeraj: As per the discussion on the "Plugin Health Score" project idea's brainstorming session, we'd like to have weight re-adjusted every 12 weeks for now.
But how often would we want to re-run the health-score-calculation algorithm for each plugin? Given that, plugin repos merge new PRs every 2-3 days (or week maybe), so we'd want to display the "updated" health score quite frequently (not only every 12 weeks).

I was thinking about re-running the algorithm on every merged PR within a plugin's repo. What are your thoughts/suggestions on this?
12/04/2022, 17:41:28 - kuro: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "As per the discussion on the "Pl..."> I agree that the updated scores (based on that quarter's weights) should be shown to the maintainers/contributors, even though every merge sounds good, can we easily capture the event that a "merge" happened? (A question to other mentors as well)
 
And how does a score update on every release sounds?
12/04/2022, 17:42:10 - Dheeraj: @adi10hero:matrix.org yes that would be very helpful :-)
But I've tried to experiment with scaling down the higher values relative to the maximum value among them. It brings down the score for a parameter, let's say "No. of Installations", to a range of 0 to 1, but it introduces a dependency between the score of this parameter among all the other plugins. Because now we're measuring the scores for this parameter relative to one plugin's installation count, which not be good for the long run...

12/04/2022, 18:18:11 - Dheeraj: I don't yet how this can be done, but something remotely similar is done by Tim Jacomb. He automated weekly changelogs creation. I don't know the exact detail and I might not be totally correct, but his script tracks every PR (on creation) that gets submitted to the jenkinsci repo and includes them in a draft changelog based on the PR labels.

If we can perform a similar behavior, every time a PR merge happens in any of the plugin repo, a script re-runs the algorithm to update the health score of that plugin. Then we might need to publish this new score every time to maintain consistency, which means on a busy day if there's lots of PR merge happening then we might come across the "readers-writers problem"...but maybe I'm going too far
12/04/2022, 18:23:06 - halkeye: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "I don't yet how this can be done..."> I think that's more effort than it's worth. Have it run once a day is probably more than enough. You can have webhooks for pull requests though so it's doable. You'll probably get large batches of PRS for dependabot so your system is going to need to be able to denounce anyways
12/04/2022, 20:01:26 - Dheeraj: I totally forgot about large batches of PRs from dependabot which we'd need to ignore anyways. Running the algo once a day and thereby updating the published scores every day sounds good. Thank you!

30/04/2022, 18:58:21 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Hey! I'm facing problem when using the "Parameterized Scheduler" Plugin(https://plugins.jenkins.io/parameterized-scheduler). I thought to use this plugin as a reference for scheduling git maintenance Cron jobs. I cloned the repo and tried debugging it, but while creating a new FreeStyle job in the UI, I don't find the option `Build periodically with parameters.`.  Do I need to setup any initial configuration to view this option?
30/04/2022, 18:59:16 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thank You. I couldn't attend the meet due to college work. 
01/05/2022, 02:07:17 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I installed the parameterized scheduler plugin and I don't see the "Build periodically with parameters" checkbox on a Freestyle project either.  Exploring further to understand if that is a bug in the plugin, a bug in the documentation, or a bug in Jenkins core
01/05/2022, 02:19:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): More exploration shows that the checkbox is not visible until a parameter is defined for the job.  A parameter is defined for a Freestyle project by clicking "This project is parameterized" and then assigning a parameter to the job.  Once that is done, then the checkbox becomes available to schedule a job with that parameter value.

01/05/2022, 09:03:48 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thank You. The checkbox is now visible. Is this the default behaviour of the plugin?
01/05/2022, 13:43:35 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I believe it is the default and expected behavior of the plugin.  When a job is not parameterized, it does not make sense to offer to schedule it with parameter values.

> Please talk to your school's international student affairs office for more details. Google can not provide you with any kind of CPT or OPT authorization. It is your responsibility to determine if your visa allows you to participate in a program like GSoC, please check before applying. You should also be sure that you can accept the stipend so you are not surprised later if you can not (often due to visa concerns).

>All accepted participants will receive an email confirmation of acceptance. We do not offer customized letters.

The learning strategy depends on where your interest lies and how comfortable you feel. A good start is to browse the various plugins and search for newbie-friendly issues. Best is to concentrate on plugins or functionalities that are important to you and you use regularly. 
Second advise is to start small to get familiar with the process (pull request, review, etc). A good start is some documentation update: they are very useful (and often forgotten). The risk of breaking something or not understanding the (sometimes overwhelming) machinery/framework is limited.
Clearly explain what you intended to do in your PR and request guidance or explanation to the maintainer or the fellow developers. Sometimes they have little time or assume pre-existent knowledge. Don't hesitate to ask if you have doubts. 
Last advise is to use the developer mailing list (jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com) to get development/contribution related support.

21/05/2022, 07:47:02 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Thank You. I love the community support and looking forward to contributing to Jenkins :)

Thank you very much! Looking forward to the exciting summer with Jenkins :-)

Thank you very much :-)
21/05/2022, 16:39:02 - Kris Stern: Congrats, everyone! 
21/05/2022, 17:24:03 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): My heartfelt gratitude toward all the mentors and the community :)
Thanks a ton for everything!
21/05/2022, 18:30:56 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Thanks for the valuable advice from the community members! The mentors are very friendly and always give the responses quickly.
22/05/2022, 16:55:03 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Can I come up with a class diagram for my implementation of the Git Maintenance project? Will it be useful to get an overview of the implementation? 
22/05/2022, 17:48:47 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If it helps you in the thinking process or in the discussion with us, then you have my full support to do it.  I'm not especially skilled with the UML or object diagramming techniques, but am happy to use pictures to have a conversation about implementation
22/05/2022, 18:00:47 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also, I am not able to use my local git-client-plugin as a dependency in the git-plugin. I wanted to test the maintenance commands in the git-client-plugin using the git-plugin. I tried adding the `<scope>system</scope>` and added path to the git-client-plugin in POM.xml of the GitPlugin. However, while building the project, I get an error. Is this the right way to proceed?
22/05/2022, 18:04:52 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): You should be able to make a local change in the git client plugin and then depend on the incremental build that results from that local change.  See https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/incrementals/#ji-toolbar for the description.  You may need to submit a draft pull request to git client plugin with your changes if you want to share them with others (like us as mentors), but that should be enough.  Then you change the git client plugin dependency in the git plugin pom to be that incremental version.

I use incremental builds frequently in my interactive test environment based on https://github.com/MarkEWaite/docker-lfs/tree/lts-with-plugins
22/05/2022, 18:14:41 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Wow! That makes things easier. Thank You.

23/05/2022, 14:01:06 - oleg-nenashev (Oleg Nenashev): And congrats to all accepted contributors and the mentoring teams!

23/05/2022, 15:56:45 - Dheeraj: In order to have more focused conversations, should I create a separate channel for the Plugin Health Score project?
23/05/2022, 16:06:29 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Thanks! I just received the invitation.
23/05/2022, 16:12:09 - Jmm: <@dheerajodha-60474fe16da0373984665858:gitter.im "In order to have more focused co..."> This is indeed useful. You can, as a team choose to create a Gitter channel or request the creation of a slack channel. Gitter should be straight forward. For Slack, I have no idea what gods need to be implored for that. Hints welcome.
23/05/2022, 16:12:54 - Jmm: Don't forget to update the project page with the information as soon as it is available.
23/05/2022, 16:23:52 - Dheeraj: Since both platforms are nice places to have discussions, I think I will then first discuss it with the team to find out where they're more comfortable interacting.

23/05/2022, 20:18:58 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Will we create separate channels for each project? I think it would be more convenient to have project-specific discussions as @dheerajodha mentioned. I personally find gitter to be quicker and easier to access, so would prefer to continue its use for the same. Any thoughts on this @mentors @tasneemkoushar @arpoch  @kwhetstone?
23/05/2022, 20:23:05 - Jmm: <@vihaanthora-61dfc3eb6da03739848e38e0:gitter.im "Will we create separate channels..."> Although I don't have the experience of previous years, I personally think that a separate channel per project is a good idea. But am interested to hear other's experience/wish/opinion.

24/05/2022, 19:08:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): So sorry, @Hrushi20 .  Starting the meeting now.  Back to back meetings are not a good thing
24/05/2022, 20:26:15 - arpoch (Harshit Chopra): It would be a good idea, as it would make the chat be more specific 
24/05/2022, 20:33:57 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): We discussed in the GSoC launch meeting for the git cache maintenance project and decided that we'll use https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/git-plugin for conversations about the project. We'll use community.jenkins.io for longer term items (meeting notes, meeting recordings, etc.).  Blog posts will continue to www.jenkins.io blog
24/05/2022, 20:34:46 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): I like having a separate channel for the projects as it makes it easier to chat about project specifics
24/05/2022, 20:42:02 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): I don't think I have permission to create a channel (I've definitely looked at this before).  Jean-Marc or Mark, could either of you create a gitter channel for our project?
24/05/2022, 20:42:44 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): It would be tied to the https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-steps-doc-generator repo (and it would be useful to have this as a channel for that repo regardless)
24/05/2022, 20:45:53 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @kwhetstone why not just use the existing https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/docs channel?  Low volume channel with docs related topics and docs related conversations already happening there
24/05/2022, 20:46:19 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Not quite as low volume as https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/git-plugin , but still low volume
24/05/2022, 21:23:25 - alyssat (Alyssat): I attempted to setup a slack channel for each project groups in CDF.

24/05/2022, 21:26:52 - alyssat (Alyssat): I'll check w/ CDF but I'm a +1 for a separate messaging channel for each projects 
24/05/2022, 21:27:37 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): @MarkEWaite that definitely works for me, how about you @vihaanthora ?
25/05/2022, 04:15:48 - Dheeraj: @alyssat while you're asking CDF, can you also please try for a separate slack channel for the Plugin Health Score project? If possible. Let me know if I can help, thanks!
25/05/2022, 04:47:55 - halkeye: couldn't you just make a new channel? or does cdf limit who can create channels?
25/05/2022, 05:02:39 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): @kwhetstone sure, I think we can start off with `jenkinsci/docs` channel, and if either the community or we feel that we should use a separate channel, we can do that in the future. 
25/05/2022, 05:05:59 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): @MarkEWaite , do we need to use the same link as yesterday to join the meet regarding Git Cache Maintenance?

25/05/2022, 05:36:19 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): We should have used the same link, but I had forgotten to schedule the session and was out of the house helping a friend with a printer problem.  My sincere apologies!  
25/05/2022, 05:37:11 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Can we have the meet some other time this week?
25/05/2022, 05:52:31 - Hrushi20 (Hrushikesh): Also @MarkEWaite can you upload yesterday session on community.jenkins.io so that I can refer to it.
25/05/2022, 05:53:42 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Will do the upload tomorrow.  Been a long day and I need sleep
25/05/2022, 08:42:32 - Dheeraj: I saw that Oleg set up the channel for the Jenkinsfile runner project, plus Alyssa mentioned that she is not able to create a channel so I thought this could only be done by a person having specific permissions from CDF's side. So I assumed I shouldn't be doing this.

But interestingly enough, I just tried to create a channel and it worked. 
Another reminder for me not to "assume" things beforehand 😃
25/05/2022, 11:16:46 - Dheeraj: I have created the #gsoc-plugin-health-score channel on the CDF slack, please feel free to join it, the more the merrier.

I'm not sure if I'd be able to invite people who aren't part of the CDF workspace, so maybe they'd need to first join the CDF workspace. Here's the link I found on their GitHub: https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-nwc0jjd0-G65oEpv5ynFfPD5oOX5Ogg
25/05/2022, 20:32:00 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): @kwhetstone do you think we should create a channel on slack and use it for our project as well?
25/05/2022, 20:34:07 - alyssat (Alyssat): Let me look into creating slack channel for each project via  CDF
26/05/2022, 01:05:46 - alyssat (Alyssat): I had Michelle in CDF create sub groups but she too was not able to invite people. She said you need to be a 'CDF member'.  She sent out invites  and hopfully once invites are accepted it will fix the issue
26/05/2022, 01:12:01 - alyssat (Alyssat): Sorry I didn't see your msg earlier.  It looks like you were successful at creating the sub group : gsoc-plugin-health-score . I was going to ask you how you did that because both Michelle (CDF) and I were not successful at it
26/05/2022, 06:17:06 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Sorry that I missed the question.  Would Friday morning your time (8:00 AM or 8:30 AM ) work OK?
26/05/2022, 06:20:24 - Hrushikesh: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "Sorry that I missed the question..."> Friday 8:30 Am would do.
26/05/2022, 15:36:46 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): Only if you think you'd like it.  I feel like we get a lot of interaction with the broader Jenkins community here on gitter and in https://community.jenkins.io/  
26/05/2022, 15:37:04 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): In previous summers, we've used gitter, and it's worked pretty well
26/05/2022, 15:39:27 - kwhetstone (Kristin Whetstone): I really want to work with people interested in docs and keep the cool work  you're doing as visible as possible :)  Especially as layout can be something you want to get a lot of feedback about, getting some eyes on what you're building is a great idea
26/05/2022, 16:11:35 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): I agree, +1 for gitter
26/05/2022, 16:32:09 - Jmm: I have also a tendency to prefer Gitter mainly because it is easy for Community to participate (no need to register/get invited, no need to install a software in its simple form, using Element allows to consolidate several channels at one place).
But it is like colours or preferred editor: it is a personal choice.
26/05/2022, 16:32:38 - Jmm: each team should find a compromise and choose what works best for them
26/05/2022, 16:33:20 - Jmm: this is a discussion item for the GSoC 2022 Kick Off meeting that starts in 30 minutes.
26/05/2022, 17:46:06 - Dheeraj: Hi Alyssa, just wanted to share my answer in more detail here.

- I joined using this invite link: https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-nwc0jjd0-G65oEpv5ynFfPD5oOX5Ogg
- Clicked on "Add channels" > "Create a new channel", then named it and hit "Create"

As I read your previous message, you've mentioned that you're having problems inviting people and it complains when we send invites to people who aren't part of the CDF Slack.

It was easier in my case because all my mentors were already a member of CDF Slack so I just had to click on "Add people" and search for their names and hit add. So, if you ask the interested people to first join CDF Slack with the link above, then you'd be able to easily add them by clicking on the "Add people" option inside your channel. I hope this helps.
26/05/2022, 19:02:53 - alyssat (Alyssat): thank you @dheerajodha
26/05/2022, 19:06:53 - alyssat (Alyssat): the recording and notes to today's GSoC kickoff is at https://community.jenkins.io/t/gsoc-2022-kickoff-meeting-may-26-2022/2556  I also updated the slide deck with links to project source codes (slide 11) and email addresses on slide 12. Thanks again everyone

28/05/2022, 14:31:40 - Jagruti joined the room
31/05/2022, 15:51:15 - Dheeraj: As per the discussion I had with my project mentors, we have mutually decided to use a new Gitter channel for the "Plugin Health Score" project.

The reason to switch here is, that even though Slack provides tons of nice features to have async conversations, it's a little difficult for people to join the channel there, especially for people who just want to have a look at how things are going on. It feels like the slack channel lives on an island, and the gitter channel, on the other side, is open and easy to use (something which Jean already mentioned)

Having said that, can anyone with relevant permissions please create a new channel? Because I tried creating by clicking on  "Create room" on the left sidebar and it is not showing me the option of "jenkinsci" under the "Select Community" dropdown.
31/05/2022, 15:53:29 - Jmm: Will chase this dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) and find out who and how it can be done (Mark is traveling currently)
31/05/2022, 15:55:52 - Dheeraj: Sure, there's no rush (we have Slack in the meantime). Thanks for the help
31/05/2022, 16:06:22 - Jmm: dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha): does "https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/GSoC-Plugin_Health_Score" work for you. I was able to create it

17/06/2022, 13:52:19 - vaibhav_2105: Hi all. I am a student of IIIT Lucknow. I am very new to open source but am familiar with the basics of networking, docker, Kubernetes, and Linux commands. Is there any way that I can contribute to Jenkins and get hands-on experience in a real DevOps project?  As a matter of fact, I am aiming for GSOC 2023.                                                                                                           My email id: jakkulavaibhav@gmail.com
17/06/2022, 13:54:38 - Jmm: Welcome vaibhav_2105 
I can only encourage you to follow that path to learn and contribute back.
17/06/2022, 13:57:11 - Jmm: Leave me some time to answer you with a structured advice. For GSoC in particular, have a close look on the documentation related to GSoC 2022 at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/
17/06/2022, 13:59:29 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @vaibhav_2105:matrix.org  yes, there are many ways to contribute to the Jenkins project.  If you're interested in Kubernetes, then you could contribute by reviewing https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/ as a new user.  Perform the steps in that documentation as a new user.  Identify steps that can be described more clearly or in more detail.  Submit a pull request (through the "Improve this page" link at the bottom of the page).

If you're interested in Docker, then you could contribute by reviewing the Docker based tutorials as a new user.  When you find that the description is incorrect, incomplete, or unclear, submit a pull request through the "Improve this page" link at the bottom of the page.

18/06/2022, 18:12:58 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I would guess that there is a DNS resolution problem in your Kubernetes cluster.  It is reporting that charts.jenkins.io is not a known host.
20/06/2022, 17:13:31 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): I used JCasC yaml file to install the maven but in the pipeline it reports 'Invalid tool ID 3.6.3'. How can I solve the problem by circumventing the Jenkins UI web page?
20/06/2022, 17:16:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): You could refer to https://github.com/MarkEWaite/docker-lfs/blob/lts-with-plugins/ref/configuration-as-code/tool.yaml as an example of a tool configuration
20/06/2022, 17:28:19 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): Thanks! It works now. I tried to use Apache id with 3.6.3 to download the maven but it cannot work and I don't know the reason. I referred the official demo in https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/tree/master/demos/maven. Is it a bug or do I need to add more configurations for that?

My previous usage:
```Yaml
tool:
  maven:
    installations:
      - name: maven3
        home: "/maven3"
        properties:
          - installSource:
              installers:
                - maven:
                    id: "3.6.3"
```
20/06/2022, 19:28:49 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): In any case, you don't want to use Apache Maven 3.6.3 for anything.  Use at least Apache maven 3.8.5, and preferably 3.8.6.  However, I haven't checked to see if that tool definition is sufficient to download Apache Maven from their servers

21/06/2022, 16:43:32 - Jmm: <@vaibhav_2105:matrix.org "Yeah, sure.Thank you :)"> Hello,
I hope you have been able to progress with your helm experiments

Mark's advice was very good.

I would add that the learning strategy depends on where your interest lies and how comfortable you feel. A good start is to browse the various plugins and search for newbie-friendly issues. Best is to concentrate on plugins or functionalities that are important to you and you use regularly.

Second advise is to start small to get familiar with the process (pull request, review, etc). A good start is some documentation update: they are very useful (and often forgotten). The risk of breaking something or not understanding the (sometimes overwhelming) machinery/framework is limited.

Clearly explain what you intended to do in your PR and request guidance or explanation to the maintainer or the fellow developers. Sometimes they have little time or assume pre-existent knowledge. Don't hesitate to ask if you have doubts.
Last advise is to use the developer mailing list (jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com) to get development/contribution related support.

Also stay tuned: from the end of August on, we will probably organise online meetings to give hints/advise and answer questions from those who would like to prepare actively for GSOC 2023.

I have gone through the document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit?usp=sharing

 and I need a little bit of clearance as I checked some plugins that already have some contributors, so my basic question is whether the general steps for modernizing a plugin can be done in those plugins as well, or do I have to go for a plugin having no contributor? 
18/08/2022, 21:46:16 - halkeye: <@iqbalrohail-60b7cc596da03739847dff1a:gitter.im "Hello, community, "> A plugin with no active contributors, you'd have to either take over, or hope someone eventually sees your PR.
A plugin with active contributors. I would let them know first (open an issue or draft pr or something) just incase they've already started.

I guess it depends on what you are referreing to when you say "has some contributors"
18/08/2022, 22:06:25 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): my point is supposed there is a plugin having other contributors, so they have already gone through the general steps for modernizing that plugin as I am a new contributor I am learning now and these steps are the possible way I could start my contributions. 
18/08/2022, 23:29:31 - halkeye: https://reports.jenkins.io/jenkins-plugin-migration.html any of the ones that are labeled TODO probably don't have anyone touching them.

MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): probably knows better ones to look into
18/08/2022, 23:44:19 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i would be checking them , thanks :)
19/08/2022, 12:24:12 - Dheeraj: As mentioned above, if you have a particular plugin repo you're referring to, then feel free to share its link here for more context.

As per my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong), some plugins might have been "modernized" to some extent by some previous contributor who followed just the first 5 tasks (say) of the document you linked above. In that case, you can either complete the remaining tasks from the document for that plugin or if you want to start fresh from Task 1, then pick a new plugin from the link shared by Gavin in the following message, and try to "modernize" it from the start.

But it wouldn't be wise to open a PR on the same task someone else already has an open PR for, without notifying them (as mentioned in the above message).
19/08/2022, 23:07:10 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hello Dheeraj , yes you got me correct.  so yes I got your point and I was also thinking the same. Thanks for the clarification and help :)

Is this regarding the blog which I need to submit? The  requirements for submission link is provided [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/work-product#requirements). Not sure what I need to do. 
12/09/2022, 15:48:48 - Jmm: It is to the artifact or artifact group you delivered. Maybe discuss it with your mentor what is best put there
12/09/2022, 16:33:19 - vihaanthora (Vihaan Thora): Hi Hrushikesh, I linked my project page in that field.
12/09/2022, 16:38:37 - Dheeraj: and I linked my project repo's URL in this field.
The project repo's README.md file would contain the final deployment URL once the deployment work gets completed later.
12/09/2022, 16:56:31 - Cr1t-GYM (Cr1t): As I have many repos at the end, I used my original project page URL for submission. In the original project page, I indexed all the repos URLs and other necessary content for evaluation such as blog post.
12/09/2022, 16:57:46 - Jmm: I thought a little about that: I think that a link to the jenkins.io project page (with all the links, documentation. repos) is OK for this
12/09/2022, 16:58:38 - Jmm: I prefer to keep the blog post for when we do the JOM.
The Project Page can be updated during the coming days even after submitting the review

25/09/2022, 11:13:04 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hello, community,
where can we find plugin documentation explaining the workflow of each plugin?  
25/09/2022, 12:52:02 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Strongest preference is that each plugin includes its  documentation inside its own GitHub repository.  That documentation is then shown to users and search engines through https://plugins.jenkins.io/ .  The documentation is usually in the README file.  See https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin#readme for an example of plugin documentation.

Plugins that provide Pipeline tasks include online help inside the plugin.  That online help is available inside the Jenkins controller through the Pipeline snippet syntax generator and is also automatically extracted to be read at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/
25/09/2022, 20:17:37 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Thankyou 
27/09/2022, 20:16:57 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hey everyone, 
how do we get to know which classes are responsible to run the Jenkins plugin controller?
27/09/2022, 21:54:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Can you provide more detail in your question and more detail about the conditions that caused you to ask the question?

If you are asking, "How can I find the classLoader that loaded the classes of my plugin?" that is a different question than "How do I find the classes that implement the Jenkins plugin manager and its dependency resolution?" and is a different question than "How do I find the classes that are part of the Jenkins controller?"

 I am Dhraj Sardar. I am  interested in jenkin project (Automatic git cache maintenance on the controller ). Can someone help me out  how can i do contribution . I am newbie  and learning the new technologies like git, linux ,java and so on from few months.
30/09/2022, 18:45:04 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @DhirajSardar that specific Google Summer of Code project has finished. It needs more testing and some UI improvements, but those tasks are probably not well suited to a first time contributor.

You may want to spend some time learning more about Jenkins, then you can decide which parts of Jenkins are interesting to you.

Some tutorials to introduce you to Jenkins
* Java and Maven - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven
* NodeJS and React - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm
* Python - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-python-app-with-pyinstaller
* Multibranch Pipeline - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-multibranch-pipeline-project/

If you're ready to jump immediately into coding, you could review the five part video series "Modernizing a plugin".  It begins with

02/10/2022, 04:51:59 - Dani-Google (Dani): Hi @MarkEWaite 

I'm a first-year Software engineering student. 

There is still a week before my first semester starts.I have already learned Linux, Python basics,Html, CSS, Docker, and Git on my own as I want to become a DevOps engineer in future and on path of self-learning and exploring
 I can blog and design occasionally as well but my main aim is DevOps and that's how I discovered Jenkins for building, testing and deploying apps.

 I loved Jenkins from the very first moment as its user friendly other than its catchy name, cool logo as it gives very cool fresh vibe :)

I'm no expert but a student, learning, and exploring every day. I love the idea of Open source  and would like to contribute in Jenkins as per my skill set. 

Please recommend me some beginner friendly tasks and details, so I can 
contribute n become a part of JENKINS :)
02/10/2022, 05:55:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): See the suggestions at https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#where-to-contribute for good starter ideas.  See earlier responses in this channel for good places to learn more about Jenkins.  As you learn more, you'll likely find areas that interest you and areas that are less interesting.  As you discover your own interests, you'll find ways to contribute to Jenkins that also address your interests.

06/10/2022, 19:29:14 - dipanshu: 
Hello Jenkins Community, I am Dipanshu.

I am a new contributor. I read the blog on **Improve the plugin** and found it very helpful to get started. A big thanks to the writers to make it so easy to understand.

I did the research and found a plugin called [Test Result Analyzer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/test-results-analyzer/) which needs modernization. 

I could see there are no issues listed on the repository. 

**Should I just fork, make changes,  test and then make the PR, or Do I need something else before making the PR ?**

06/10/2022, 19:32:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Those are the right steps @_dipansh_twitter .  
06/10/2022, 19:35:19 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Steps that plugin needs include:
* Update parent pom
* Update Jenkins version
* Automate dependency updates
* Use plugin bill of materials
* Add a contributing guide
06/10/2022, 19:37:35 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @_dipansh_twitter each of those should be a separate pull request.  Some of them may require that you combine multiple steps to complete the single step.  If you encounter problems, ask questions here and we'll do our best to answer
06/10/2022, 23:08:23 - dipanshu: **Thanks @MarkEWaite for the overview**
06/10/2022, 23:08:41 - dipanshu: I made PR's for updating parent POM. [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/53).

I also resolved the **UpperBoundDeps error** while updating the Jenkins base version by implementing BOM. 

I tested the new build and it passed.

But i was wondering since i removed the **<java.level>** property ([refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/54)) and upgrade the POM version 

I don't have a deep understanding of git version control but **i fear it may create some merge conflicts**.

**Is it ok to make the PR for Jenkins base version upgrade or should I wait for the PR's to be merged so that i don't need to update the POM and delete the <java.level> property in every new branch**.
06/10/2022, 23:11:48 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Good question.  I approved and merged your pull request to update the parent pom.  The delete of java.level is now being evaluated by the CI job.  Will merge it once it passes CI
06/10/2022, 23:14:14 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): It is OK to make a PR for Jenkins base version upgrade without waiting for the predecessor PR to merge.  When you create the new branch for the new capability, first merge the predecessor branches into the new branch.  Then start the work on the new capability.  Hopefully I'll keep up with your pace proposing pull requests and you won't need to spend too much time doing that
06/10/2022, 23:28:30 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin pull request has merged @_dipansh_twitter 
06/10/2022, 23:31:48 - dipanshu: I never thought of doing it this way, It would be very efficient.

This is my first pull request to be merged into an open source project :).

07/10/2022, 00:28:11 - dipanshu: Some queries regarding the update of base Jenkins version

- Implemented the BOM to remove the **UpperBoundDeps error**
- In order to do I saw that it mentions that we could remove the version definition 
- It builds and passes every check without the version definition. Is it safe to remove that.


07/10/2022, 01:41:08 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, if the code still compiles with a version definition removed, then that version is being provided by either the parent pom or the BOM
07/10/2022, 07:43:11 - Dheeraj: That's amazing, congratulations!!
07/10/2022, 11:43:22 - dipanshu: While updating  scm URL [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/blob/master/pom.xml#L42) 

I found that it uses a SSH protocol not a plain git protocol.

I found a documentation regarding the **differences and trade-off between SSH and HTTPS** [refer](https://gist.github.com/grawity/4392747)

**Overall I'm leaning towards using HTTPS over SSH as it is the one that github  recommends us to use**

Please Do let me know if I should leave as it is or change it to HTTPS ?
07/10/2022, 11:58:16 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There are two URL's in the SCM configuration.  One is for general purpose access (read only) and the other is for developer access (read and write).  The general purpose access should be https because it does not require any private key to be registered with GitHub.  The developer access can be either SSH or https because read/write can be done with either protocol.
07/10/2022, 12:01:49 - dipanshu: okay got it, I'll change it HTTPS
the PR for base Jenkins version update is build and verified [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/55)

07/10/2022, 12:07:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Merged.  Thanks very much.  I hope you're willing to continue on that plugin, since there are several more modernization steps that would help it.  I'd especially like to have the documentation migrated from the Wiki to the GitHub repository, then we could create a new release of the plugin with updated documentation.
07/10/2022, 12:23:15 - dipanshu: I'd would love contribute and help.

Will be working on documentation soon

Since, I am very new to open source and Jenkins I might need help to understand the concepts and workflow better 

The [PR](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/56) for https protocol change is build and verified
07/10/2022, 12:30:32 - dipanshu: Thanks @dheerajodha

07/10/2022, 14:45:53 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Vandit1604 see the suggestions at https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#where-to-contribute for good starter ideas.  See earlier responses in this channel for good places to learn more about Jenkins.  As you learn more, you'll likely find areas that interest you and areas that are less interesting.  As you discover your own interests, you'll find ways to contribute to Jenkins that also address your interests.

Yeah, sure it would be perfect.
I'll continue to modernize the other aspects of the plugin

As per the error, maybe there's already an existing folder named similar to the one that you are trying to unzip now.

07/10/2022, 21:14:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): It is usually much less complicated if you create a tools directory in your user directory and put all your tools there.  Maven does not need to be installed into the Windows system directories.
07/10/2022, 21:15:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): In my case, I have `C:\Tools\apache-maven-3.8.6` but I could have also done `C:\Users\MarkE\tools\apache-maven-3.8.6`
08/10/2022, 08:17:40 - AayushSaini101 (Zack_Aayush): @MarkEWaite Sir, Can we add the view and like option on the cards of the jenkins plugins. Like https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/zack_aayush/articles on the article, and also we can add a feedback funnel on the plugin to track the issues in the efficient ways.
08/10/2022, 08:35:33 - halkeye: I don't think we want to store plugin issues in more places. We already have them in multiple places
08/10/2022, 09:17:03 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): @MarkEWaite i created a directory for tools and copied maven.zip there and changed my path to it in enviorment variables still its not working

08/10/2022, 09:32:58 - dipanshu: I was working on increasing the depth of spotbugs analysis. 

**I increased the Effort to Max and threshold to low**

While testing it gave an error which made the build to fail 

```
[ERROR] Low: Use of non-localized String.toUpperCase() or String.toLowerCase() At TestCaseResultData.java:[line 18]
```

**The fix is adding a Locale.ROOT as a argument in toLowerCase()** at [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/testresultsanalyzer/result/data/TestCaseResultData.java#L18)

```
-     String status = ((String) statusReturnValue).toLowerCase();
+    String status = ((String) statusReturnValue).toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
```

**But adding this restricts us to using only Latin letters **

Let me know what should I do.
08/10/2022, 09:48:01 - dipanshu: Locale.ENGLISH would presumably also be a safe choice.
08/10/2022, 09:55:13 - Ulli Hafner: I typically use the ENGLISH locale.
08/10/2022, 15:08:43 - AayushSaini101 (Zack_Aayush): Okay sir, what about the like feature 
08/10/2022, 15:15:24 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Can you explain how you would see a "like" feature being used?  The plugins site shows the number of installations of a plugin.  The plugin health scoring project is assembling a collection of measurements that will help further guide administrators as they decide if they should install a particular plugin.  The project description is at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/plugin-health-scoring-system/ and the report on the GSoC 2022 implementation of a portion of the project is at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/projects/plugin-health-scoring-system/

I'll continue to modernize other aspects 

Any suggestions for improvements that I can work on ??

08/10/2022, 23:16:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There are a number of other suggestions for improvements in the "Contributing to Open Source" workshop document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit?usp=sharing
08/10/2022, 23:17:56 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're ready to adopt the plugin, you could take that step as well.  Adoption instructions are at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/
08/10/2022, 23:18:42 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Beginning early next week, I won't be available to review pull requests.  I'm taking a 2+ week vacation and won't be available.
09/10/2022, 16:57:40 - dipanshu: Wishing you a great vacation, Have a wonderful time! @MarkEWaite

I'll look into the adopt-the-plugin documentation.

Made two PR's
- https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/60
- https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/61

I am working on CONTRUBUTING.md for the plugin.

I think most of the aspects of this plugin have been modernized.

So, should I work on some different plugin which needs to be modernized or stick to this one and improve it in more ways ?
09/10/2022, 19:48:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Your choice, but I'm confident there is much more to be done on any plugin, including that one.  The "Improve a Plugin" tutorial provides only the very first steps.
If you'd like to learn more about writing automated tests with JUnit, then https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/test-results-analyzer-plugin/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/coverage/ shows that over 60% of the Java statements in that plugin are not executed by the automated tests.  Adding more automated tests is an interesting learning experience to explore a plugin and improve skills writing and verifying test code.
09/10/2022, 19:51:17 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you'd rather work on a plugin that is much more visible, the lockable resources plugin is widely installed and up for adoption.  There are reviewers ready to look at modernization pull requests for the lockable resources plugin.  Other plugins that need modernization and have willing code reviewers include:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin 
https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-condition-plugin 
https://github.com/jenkinsci/parameterized-trigger-plugin

09/10/2022, 22:07:17 - dipanshu: Thanks you @MarkEWaite for an elaborate overview.

I'd like to learn and add more automated tests Junit tests for the plugin. However, I have little prior working knowledge of Junit. 

**Any specific references to get started with Junit in reference to plugin ?**

I'll also explore the mentioned plugins in the meanwhile and look for some aspects to modernize.
10/10/2022, 15:42:20 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): My technique to learn about writing tests with JUnit has been to follow the steps that a Hacktoberfest contributor added to the contributing guide of the node label parameter plugin.  See https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-coverage for those steps
1. Generate the coverage report of the Java classes and methods that are not covered by automated tests `mvn clean -DskipTests verify` to compile without running tests, then `mvn -P enable-jacoco clean verify jacoco:report`
2. View the report in a web browser
3. Open one of the untested classes in an IDE (Visual Studio Code, Intellij, Apache Netbeans) and use the "Create tests" feature of the IDE
4. Insert test implementations into one of the stubs that was created by the IDE, submit a pull request with that single test so that code review happens quickly
10/10/2022, 15:51:37 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): You can read the pull requests from that Hacktoberfest contributor at:
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/pull/165
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/pull/166
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/pull/167

The discussion is in one of the gitter chat channels as well, in case that helps
11/10/2022, 18:49:11 - dipanshu: Thanks @MarkEWaite,  The references made it much easier to comprehend how the test is actually constructed.

However, I've only been working with Junit for a day and still have a lot to learn about unit testing.

As my first unit test, I tried to implement a test for [ResultStatus.getValue()](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/testresultsanalyzer/ResultStatus.java#L14)

**I think it is working as expected. Could I make the PR with this implementation ?**

While I was working on writing tests i found this [test](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/blob/master/src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/testresultsanalyzer/result/AnalyzerPageTest.java#L17) had @Ignore annotation and says it needs some fix.

I was wondering whether to take this specific test and attempt to debug and fix it or whether to continue developing new tests till I had more understanding about tests.

I'm out of the office for the next 2.5 weeks, so may not be fast with feedback.  Will need to rely on others like Jean-Marc Meessen, Bruno Verachten, and @uhafner:matrix.org 
12/10/2022, 14:45:06 - dipanshu: I'll keep working on  implementing new tests.

I made a PR this with the above implementation [refer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin/pull/62).

23/10/2022, 15:46:47 - Prakriti Mandal: Hello myself Prakriti, a novice opensource contributor pursuing education in CSE .I believe in contributing in opensource. In order to be a part of jenkins community as well as to contribute in jenkins repo what is the requirements I must be seeking? I have knowledge of Java and learning web dev in javascript. What is the way I should follow to contribute and to know about jenkins?
24/10/2022, 13:01:28 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Can somebody looks here? I am not java programmer and I am not sure if I do it in propper way.

24/10/2022, 13:01:35 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): any help are welcome
24/10/2022, 15:25:21 - Kris Stern: You may want to take a look at this for contributing to Jenkins as a newcomer: https://www.jenkins.io/participate/
24/10/2022, 15:28:14 - Kris Stern: Prakriti Mandal: If you are aiming to participate in GSoC 2023 you may want to take your time warming up to the community since the next application cycle will be early 2023. You can ask further questions for contributing here or at say #jenkinsci_jenkins:gitter.im or #jenkinsci_newcomer-contributors:gitter.im 
24/10/2022, 15:30:47 - Kris Stern: And there is still time left to contribute via Hactoberfest, on our dedicated webpage you can find links to suitable issues to work on: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/
25/10/2022, 20:44:40 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hello ,  
I am getting the error while building the plugin maybe due to maven version conflicts . can anyone guide me about my query 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74198682/sudo-mvn-version-and-mvn-version-shows-different-versions
25/10/2022, 20:47:51 - halkeye: iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): root (sudo) often has different PATH variables to prevent people accidently running something from an insecure location.
25/10/2022, 20:48:19 - halkeye: honestly, i don't see why you'd want to sudo maven at all
25/10/2022, 20:52:09 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): while doing sudo mvn clean verify it automatically downloads the dependencies but when I did that with simple mvn clean verify it doesn't doing the thing 
25/10/2022, 20:52:25 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i was thinking maybe thats the issue 
25/10/2022, 21:03:05 - halkeye: it should automatically download dependancies as non root too. Sudo should only be used to make system changes, should never be used for day to day stuff.
25/10/2022, 21:35:10 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): @halkeye:g4v.dev i will try doing that
25/10/2022, 21:40:40 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): is this plugin https://github.com/jenkinsci/http-request-plugin
bound with java 8 ??
25/10/2022, 21:45:50 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): [logfile.txt](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/Gnyo/logfile.txt)
25/10/2022, 21:46:24 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): @halkeye:g4v.dev  here is the logs file kindly have a look
25/10/2022, 23:10:56 - halkeye: iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): thats very weird indeed. You could delete all your downloaded stuff by doing `rm -rf $HOME/.m2/repository/jenkins*`. It may be a corrupted download or something.
26/10/2022, 09:38:11 - Prakriti Mandal: <@krisstern:matrix.org "You may want to take a look at t..."> Ok Kris Stern I will be looking on it.
28/10/2022, 07:00:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Not sure what you mean when you say "bound with Java 8".  If you are asking if it supports Java 8, the answer is "yes".  If you are asking if it can only be compiled with Java 8, then the answer is "no, it can be compiled with Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17 as shown by https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/http-request-plugin/job/master/108/pipeline-graph/
28/10/2022, 14:41:29 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Thanks for the guidance :)
28/10/2022, 19:39:28 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hey hope so everyone is doing great,
I want to add a spotbug check in https://github.com/jenkinsci/http-request-plugin
<spotbugs.threshold>Low</spotbugs.threshold>

28/10/2022, 19:41:24 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/cn3R/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/cn3R/image.png)
28/10/2022, 19:42:59 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): It's showing some errors, how to overcome them, can anyone guide, please?
28/10/2022, 19:51:31 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @iqbalrohail See https://github.com/jenkins-docs/lockable-resources-plugin/pull/3/files for an example that shows two different techniques to silence spotbugs warnings.  One technique is to make a code change.  I do those when I feel very confident that I understand the change and can justify that change in a commit.  The other technique is to place the specific file name and warning ID in an exclusion file.  Both techniques provide the benefit that future submissions will detect new spotbugs warnings
28/10/2022, 21:13:59 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): mark i am trying to resolve some checks by code changes , can you tell how I can assign a serialVersionUID ?
28/10/2022, 21:14:33 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i think this will solve this spotbug error 
[ERROR] Low: jenkins.plugins.http_request.auth.CredentialNtlmAuthentication is Serializable; consider declaring a serialVersionUID [jenkins.plugins.http_request.auth.CredentialNtlmAuthentication] At CredentialNtlmAuthentication.java:[lines 25-67] SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONID
28/10/2022, 21:20:07 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11881621/understanding-of-findbugs-warning-about-serialversionuid-field
28/10/2022, 21:20:55 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I haven't found serialVersionUID to be very useful in the places where I've been warned about it, so I tend to exclude it from the spotbugs warnings rather than include it as a code change
28/10/2022, 21:31:15 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): thanks alot 
28/10/2022, 21:36:07 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): does setting this 1 a good practice ?
28/10/2022, 22:54:37 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i have added spotbugs-exclude file as well but it shows me same thing after adding 
28/10/2022, 22:57:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): That almost always means you made a mistake either by not including a reference to the excludes file in the pom.xml file or by not including the correct reference to the class name in the excludes file
28/10/2022, 23:01:13 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): how that file will executes , what I was thinking that  by 
    <spotbugs.excludeFilterFile>${project.basedir}/src/spotbugs/spotbugs-excludes.xml</spotbugs.excludeFilterFile>
 
28/10/2022, 23:02:30 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, https://github.com/jenkins-docs/lockable-resources-plugin/pull/3/files uses that form
28/10/2022, 23:03:39 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Be sure that you're declaring the fully qualified class name and be sure that you are not declaring a methodName for the serial version UID exclusion
28/10/2022, 23:03:46 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): yes i did the same
28/10/2022, 23:04:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I'll need to see the code in a pull request.  Guessing won't work as effectively as seeing what you're trying and then exploring it further
28/10/2022, 23:04:58 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): i have not added method name , I thinks only class name with path is enough
28/10/2022, 23:09:09 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): https://github.com/jenkinsci/http-request-plugin/pull/117
28/10/2022, 23:09:38 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): thats the PR your , 
28/10/2022, 23:19:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I've pushed the changes.  Class, field and method names had mistakes in them.  The class, method, and field names need to exactly match those reported by the spotbugs output
28/10/2022, 23:39:06 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): thanks for the review and change mark , it runs fine now 
28/10/2022, 23:44:52 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): https://github.com/jenkinsci/http-request-plugin/pull/116

I am a working backend SDE in Java with 4 months of experience and knowledge of C++.
I am new to open source and would appreciate guidance to how can I join the community and  gain hands on experience with contributing to open source.
Please suggest me on how to get started and need to know beforehand.
Thank you!
29/10/2022, 17:41:11 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): @Subzer0570  there are many steps how to starts and where to contribute. The question is what are you looking for. Development, Testing Documentation. Project-administration ... ? Anyway we are still looking for more contributors in https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin. Maybe you are interested 😉 . In that case contrinute in the discussion chanel. note. It is better to start with some 'small' plugin, then with jenkins-core. note2: Of cores you need a github account.
29/10/2022, 17:44:37 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Hello Martin @mPokornyETM, I am looking for development, I would really appreciate if you can guide me in which chatroom to discuss and how to get started in development. Thanks!
29/10/2022, 18:05:14 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): @mPokornyETM
before contributing on that plugin, can you please tell me what things do I need to know and what part of the plugin I'll be needed to contirbute
29/10/2022, 19:22:05 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Looks in the room too newcomer-contributors
29/10/2022, 19:31:12 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Look in this room newcomer-contributors. But i don't find there so much things 
29/10/2022, 19:34:03 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Basically you need github account.  And in many plugin you will find issues marked as 'good first issue' like this https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22
30/10/2022, 04:05:18 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/ is a tutorial that includes a series of small development steps for a new contributor.
30/10/2022, 16:27:08 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Welcome to the community , you can have a look on this document 'Contributing to Open Source' 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit#
follow the steps  ,  watch the video tutorials .
trust me this will benefit a lot!

30/10/2022, 20:36:28 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There are two developer tutorials if you're interested.  One for creating a new plugin (less needed with 1800+ plugins already existing) and one for improving a plugin (lots of need to improve plugins that already exist)

See earlier responses in this channel for good places to learn more about Jenkins.  As you learn more, you'll likely find areas that interest you and areas that are less interesting.

Google did not announce officially the new edition (but probability is very high).
A blog post about GSoC2023@Jenkins will be published shortly.

But it is a very good initiative to start preparing for it. Get to know the Jenkins Community, read the various documentations, and learn by submitting pull-request.

15/11/2022, 15:34:08 - Jmm: There you go, Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal) . You are better informed than me. Thanks for sharing the link
15/11/2022, 15:34:39 - Jmm: We will organise (in January/Feb) an info-session on how to get best prepared for GSoC and present a strong submission. Stay tuned.
15/11/2022, 15:34:56 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): Thank you so much
15/11/2022, 15:35:07 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I assume you are gonna be our mentor for next year?
15/11/2022, 15:36:12 - Jmm: Being an Org Admin for Jenkins will be already plenty of work. But Org Admin as we understand it at Jenkins is also some sort of mentoring.
15/11/2022, 15:37:27 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I see
15/11/2022, 15:38:00 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I have experience with Python and Go, and a bit of C and C++ too. Hoping that would be enough.
15/11/2022, 15:39:10 - Jmm: Jenkins is mainly a Java application. 😐️
15/11/2022, 15:40:50 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I am ready to learn Java when needed.
15/11/2022, 15:42:32 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I will start learning it from today itself.
15/11/2022, 15:42:44 - Jmm: I like that. So start learning by selecting a couple of issues (simple first and than more challenging).
15/11/2022, 15:43:23 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): You mean of Jenkins or Java?
15/11/2022, 15:44:45 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): What Java version does Jenkins use?
15/11/2022, 15:45:43 - Jmm: I mean: learning java (and Jenkins) by picking up an issue, study the issue by reproducing it,  read other people's code, and propose a fix (in Java)
15/11/2022, 15:46:41 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): From now itself? Ok
15/11/2022, 15:47:31 - Jmm: Have a look at the developer documentation. Jenkins is currently qualified for Java 11 but we are moving at a fast pace to make it compatible with Java 17.
15/11/2022, 15:48:06 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I see
15/11/2022, 15:48:24 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I will ask here when I have doubts or help is needed
15/11/2022, 16:05:40 - Jmm: For technical (programming) questions, you are better to ask on the developer mailing list. This channel is focusing on announcements and guidance about the GSoC program. 
15/11/2022, 17:10:14 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): When somebody has skills with object oriented languages like C++, then learn Java is not so big issue 😉

15/11/2022, 18:54:36 - anurag-sachan (Anurag Sachan): @jmmeessen:matrix.org Hi Jmm, last time I applied to Jenkins for the first time and was new to community, now that I have some basic understanding of Java, Jenkins (majorly pipeline), maven, plugins & microservices, could you guide me on how to make quality contributions and understand production level projects as I recently got rejected for MLH but I want to learn & do not want to miss GSOC 2023 opportunity.
17/11/2022, 18:48:42 - Jmm: An important characteristic of working on Open Source is that we work in the open and that everything is shared. People that participate to GSoC will learn and experiment this way of communicating and working.
I receive several invites for private conversations on Gitter. 

I prefer to avoid these 1:1 conversations. Please ask your questions or make your points publicly: there is no stupid question, others will benefit for the question and the answer, and there are no secrets to hide.
I understand that required to communicate publicly is difficult, gives you the impression to be in danger, and looks weird. This is probably completely new to many but it is part of the GSoC teaching and the ways of OSS.

You can mention me directly in public messages (and remind me if you didn't get the expected answer). But I will not get into private conversation. Thank you for your understanding.

17/11/2022, 21:38:14 - Jmm: Although we are quite early in GSoC2023, a lot of members of this channel are wondering how is works, how  to prepare, and many other questions. 
We are preparing an online session where we will answer as many question as we can. (The session will recorded if you aren't available at that time). We plan to have that first session begin December.

Stay tuned. We will announce this session on various channels.

In the meantime, read all the available documentation, on the GSoC, or on the Jenkins.io site (sub-projects menu). Of particular interest are the recommendations for contributors (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/)

And of course, get confortable with java development, read Jenkins documentation, install your own server and experiment. And look at some beginner issues and try to contribute to learn the process. We'll come back on this during our online session.

17/11/2022, 23:48:55 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Does Jenkins have any project based on spring boot ? Or just preferably focused over core Java 
17/11/2022, 23:52:10 - Ulli Hafner: No, we don't. Spring boot arrived after Jenkins was born. 
17/11/2022, 23:53:14 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): And also please suggest me the areas in the jenkin plugin where the Junit tests can be written means I want to start working on writting or improving tests for plugins where could I start ?
17/11/2022, 23:56:45 - Ulli Hafner: There is our list of open newbie friendly issues: https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly

19/11/2022, 17:29:13 - shraddha761 (shraddha761): can i start working on this project. I need some guidance on it. 
19/11/2022, 17:38:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Sure @shraddha761 .  https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin is a plugin that is looking for someone to adopt it.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/ is a tutorial of steps that can improve a plugin through a series of small, useful pull requests.  If that list is complete, then there is a Google Doc that lists many more ideas at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit#heading=h.hvd0nm6pz5o4

This chat channel contains many other suggestions of ways that new contributors can help.  

You can look in here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin we still need support and few issues for beginners https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22. In that case I would do my best to support you.

19/11/2022, 17:46:14 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): Hey @MarkEWaite 

Do you think I can pick some documentation good first issues too?

I would like to work on this one: https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin/issues/322


The only description the issue contains is:

`please show example with Declarative syntax`

This is not quite descriptive for me 😟



19/11/2022, 17:49:28 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): I understand what `declarative syntax` is. But I do not know what examples it speaks of? 

Is the `README.md` examples?
19/11/2022, 18:38:58 - halkeye: I would recommend looking into jenkins declarative syntax. It's a core part of pipelines and jenkins now.

The current examples in readme.md are scripted syntaz
19/11/2022, 19:47:08 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): @jagrutitiw_twitter hi. I
19/11/2022, 19:49:19 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Please get in contact with me in gitter or better post a comment in the issue. I think there is a test for declarative pipeline.  So you can grab the test code and bring it in readme file as well  😉 
19/11/2022, 19:51:06 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Slowly is the file too big. So when you will bring more examples I will propose to create new examples.md file. 
19/11/2022, 19:52:49 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): So please write in the issue that you want do it and I will assign it to you. All of the discussions can be done there. And many thx for contributing 
20/11/2022, 05:12:25 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): I already have commented on the issue. 
20/11/2022, 05:15:34 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): Hey @mPokornyETM 

I have commented my doubt on Github: https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin/issues/322#issuecomment-1321034547
20/11/2022, 05:30:49 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): Hey @halkeye:g4v.dev
20/11/2022, 05:31:14 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): Did you mean this documentation: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/
20/11/2022, 11:45:06 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hey @MarkEWaite , do we have any document or guideline on How the Jenkins Docker image and Configuration as Code (CasC) work?


20/11/2022, 14:37:55 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/README.md#getting-started will helps you
20/11/2022, 15:00:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @iqbalrohail there are also various publicly visible examples of Jenkins implementations that use configuration as code with the Jenkins docker image to maintain the contents of the container.  @halkeye:g4v.dev has a repository that others have referenced previously (I don't recall the URL).  I have a "strange use case" repository that I use for rapid setup and teardown of test configurations.  Sam Gleske has a git repository that helps as well https://github.com/samrocketman/jenkins-bootstrap-shared

20/11/2022, 21:24:15 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Hey there everyone! I'm Pratik, I want to contribute to GSOC'23 through Jenkins. Don't know if this is the right channel to ask this question. My doubt is about the Jenkins codebase. I've reading through the codebase for the past couple of days and trying to figure out how everything works. What timeframe do you think is required to understand the whole or at least the most important parts of Jenkins backend? (I'm familiar with basics of conventional Java and have experience with developing android apps using Java) I'm new to the Jenkins community so extremely so sorry if this question sounds silly😅
20/11/2022, 21:26:10 - Jmm: Hello and welcome pratik2315 (pratik2315) 
The short answer to your question is: It depends..... 🙂
And your question isn't silly at all
20/11/2022, 21:27:07 - Jmm: To try to be a little more specific in my answer, it depends on how much time you can invest and if you are a quick learner.
20/11/2022, 21:29:06 - Jmm: There are several learning paths described higher in this thread. The advise on the GSoC and Hacktoberfest pages are also a very good start (and have several pointer to go further).
20/11/2022, 21:32:00 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Thanks for the detailed response @jmmeessen:matrix.org I'll go through the references you listed👍
20/11/2022, 21:32:12 - Jmm: And first of all, try to install Jenkins locally and play with it. It will be useful to understand the GSoC project proposal and (newbie)  issue description
20/11/2022, 21:43:34 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Makes sense. Got it👍
20/11/2022, 22:22:24 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): As @jmmeessen:matrix.org suggested to run Jenkins locally and play with it , it is also a plus point if you @pratik2315  start learning about Jenkins tool and have knowledge of ci/cd as currently I am doing the same to have good understanding of what actually Jenkins do ... Also I would suggest you to learn about junit to write improve  tests for various plugins 
20/11/2022, 22:24:39 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Seniors are requested to correct me if I am not right so I could improve myself too ...thanks
 
20/11/2022, 23:26:51 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Thanks man @iqbalrohail i appreciate the help. I have worked with Junit before so that may be a plus😄
21/11/2022, 15:56:52 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Yes @pratik2315 it's good that you know junit , you can checkout some plugins and have a look on tests written in them . Check what you can do with them ...

However, ![I run into this error](https://imgur.com/a/e4OTgdG) . Till now, I have tried `mvn clean` and `mvn clean install` Commands. None of these seem to work. Therefore, I am working on all the suggested solutions [from](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45337558/failed-to-execute-goal-org-apache-maven-pluginsmaven-enforcer-plugin) . Shall keep all of you posted if I find a solution. I would also love some advice on the same.

15/12/2022, 12:49:13 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): `mvn clean install -Denforcer.skip=true` works , however, since I am new to maven and jenkins, I don't really know if they are the same thing.
15/12/2022, 13:04:09 - Ulli Hafner: The message indicates a problem in the pom.xml. It seems that some URLs are using HTTP and not HTTPS. So do not use `-Denforcer.skip=true`, better fix the problem!
15/12/2022, 13:08:26 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Whenever i get this error i check the java version in parent pom and use that jdk version. It works for me you can try it and also uske maven 3.8.6 it'll work fine 
15/12/2022, 13:40:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The maven version that you're using is too old.  You're using Apache Maven 3.6.3. 
 The Jenkins project requires Maven 3.8.1 or newer and recommends 3.8.6.  The default download from the Apache Maven web site provides 3.8.6. 
 See https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
15/12/2022, 16:25:26 - Dheeraj: Also, I find it helpful to look at the error messages to see if there's something I'm missing. In your screenshot, you can see the text:

`3.8.1 required to no longer download dependencies via HTTP (use HTTPS instead).`

And you can see that the maven version you're using is `Maven Version: 3.6.3`
That is why you're seeing the errors. So, please use the recommended 3.8.6 maven version.
18/12/2022, 09:17:29 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): All I had to do was upgrade maven and that worked wonders.. Thanks a lot

I am guessing that you are facing the issue when trying to start Jenkins.io on your local machine. 
I don't have a clear view of what is failing at what stage so I will give it a few long shots.
- did it already work or is this the first jenkins.io make run you try?
- is your working branch in synch with the latest changes on master ? I know that some dependencies updates were made during the week-end. Always a good idea to rebase your working branch with the upstream/master branch.
- did you try to start your own copy of Jenkins.io on Gitpod (it is often a good reference to cross-check local configuration)
20/12/2022, 11:48:59 - Jmm: Note, daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas), there might be something smelly: my first own first attempt failed. Am investigating it.
20/12/2022, 12:05:00 - Jmm: False alarm (and my bad): it is always a good idea to do a `make clean` (cleaning the work environment)  after a dependency change and if things don't work as expected).

21/12/2022, 09:17:09 - halkeye: Those 3 screenshots seem to say the same thing. And the error would be much higher up in the output 
21/12/2022, 09:49:34 - Jmm: Hi daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas) ,
- Did you run `make clean` before (it fixed my setup yesterday) ?
- Is it possible to attach the whole output of the `make run` command ? 
21/12/2022, 10:50:16 - Ulli Hafner: Our https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/ page seems to be broken, the people images are too high, is this already known?
21/12/2022, 10:51:58 - Jmm: Oops. no, I am not aware of issues with that page (it is generated automatically). Looking into it (with a cleaned cache)
21/12/2022, 10:56:05 - Ulli Hafner sent an image. (Media omitted)
21/12/2022, 10:56:13 - Ulli Hafner: Hmm, seems to render not correctly in Safari. Chrome looks ok.
21/12/2022, 10:57:33 - Ulli Hafner: Even after cleaning the cache it remains this way...
21/12/2022, 10:57:37 - Jmm: Ulli Hafner: That is indeed ugly and broken 
21/12/2022, 10:58:12 - Ulli Hafner: Firefox is fine as well.
21/12/2022, 10:58:45 - Jmm: I only use Chrome as reference Web Browser. I will see if I can reproduce your glitch on my safari here.
21/12/2022, 11:00:05 - Jmm: The bug is confirmed: I have the same "uglyness" with my Safari
21/12/2022, 11:03:22 - Jmm: Will have a look how to fix this. This is the code used to generate the page: /content/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas.html.haml (probably a .css issue).Suggestion/correction is welcome
21/12/2022, 11:15:16 - Jmm: I have no clue where the mentor macro is defined. But I have only a very shallow knowledge of haml
21/12/2022, 11:16:13 - Jmm: I need help for this one
21/12/2022, 19:17:12 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): can you provide the complete stack trace?
21/12/2022, 19:31:26 - halkeye: <@jmmeessen:matrix.org "Will have a look how to fix this..."> https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/a04d54e3070e43c7b7f89fba21881a7a looks like height isn't provided so safari wants to just fill the height of the square.

The message "Missing name for author" probably means that the site generator was expecting to find an author entry for you in the https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/tree/master/content/_data/authors directory. 
22/12/2022, 00:48:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're willing to push your local changes to a draft pull request on jenkins.io, it may be easier to deduce what's happening in the site generation process that is causing the failure.

thank you 
hmm that's intresting as there's no *selector_exclude* property in there so why does it by default not index the code snippets from what i've read in [DocSearch Docs](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/record-extractor) i'll look if there's a way to explicitly tell Algolia Crawler to index code snippets too
25/12/2022, 08:09:17 - halkeye: I think it already is indexing it, just body isn't weighted higher than titles

yes titles are mainly used and if the title is not proper relevant information can be skipped 
i have already raised a PR https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5841 but wouldn't it be awesome if we can highlight some portion in code too i searched and found out that you can add a paragraph tag inside code block in *.md files and crawler will index the things inside paragraph tag but *.adoc files dont have a tag like that normal text is considered paragraph in adoc

25/12/2022, 18:12:08 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): i have already tried other `make <target>` they all get stuck 
im using codespaces can that could be a factor ?

25/12/2022, 18:15:55 - halkeye: Stuck or a lot of cpu? I think the build process is pretty heavy
25/12/2022, 18:17:15 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): i have waited many hours before when i used only `make` it also gets stuck 
i'll try running them locally then 
25/12/2022, 18:19:55 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Oh it started again , sorry my bad
25/12/2022, 18:26:23 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): If after running `make user-site GITHUB_USERNAME=<USERNAME>` site is hosted on my fork of jenkins.io does it mean there's no failure after my changes?
sorry for asking too many questions 
thank you for your time 

25/12/2022, 18:35:29 - halkeye: I don't know if user site still work but it's supposed to create output that you can upload to GitHub.io pages. Lemme get out of bed and see what it does
25/12/2022, 19:01:03 - halkeye: oh yea it does publish
25/12/2022, 19:01:51 - halkeye: assuming it worked, it would have shown up at https://vandit1604.github.io/jenkins.io/ but you might need to enable github pages on that repo
25/12/2022, 19:02:06 - halkeye: do you need publish it? what are you trying to do?
25/12/2022, 19:02:21 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): yes it did i was testing my changes
25/12/2022, 19:03:03 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): so i thought if this works that means all tests passed
but i was wrong some checks failed when i raised a PR
25/12/2022, 19:03:20 - halkeye: `make` by itself makes the site and puts it into build/_site/sitemap, then i use a static server (ex `python3 -m http.server`) to serve that directory and test it

I checked crowdin.jenkins.io and obviously the plugin doesnt exist there and thats my task (I believe) to integrate with it. 
Where am I supposed to start? by creating my own workflow and building on it or something else?
I googled for like 2 hours but it didn't help much.
Can someone guide me?

27/12/2022, 04:21:54 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Should I be first submitting an issue at jenkins-infra?
If yes, should it be my repo or the jenkins repo link and who would be user(I checked and I cannot be the user)
27/12/2022, 04:22:22 - halkeye: i don't think those are things third parties can do, i think its one of the maintainers that has to set it all up, and want it setup. Warnings-ng is very heavily maintained. Is there a reason you picked that one to do ?
27/12/2022, 04:25:37 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): There is no specific reason to choose this issue, this was the first issue assgined to me and I was planning to atleast set crowdin for this project because I cannot do any translations
27/12/2022, 04:28:11 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Message deleted
27/12/2022, 04:28:58 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): I'll discuss with Ulli Hafner(Reporter of this issue) on this
27/12/2022, 04:29:19 - halkeye: it was assigned to you? i don't know enough about gsoc and whats going on.
Essentially you'd need to create some github actions (which is what your first screenshot says), you can do that as a fork, then submit it as a PR, but I think you also need to setup github actions secrets to talk to crowdin api
27/12/2022, 04:29:40 - halkeye: i'm no expert at crowdin though
27/12/2022, 04:34:21 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): > There is no specific reason to choose this issue, this was the first issue assgined to me and I was planning to atleast set crowdin for this project because I cannot do any translations

@MarkEWaite asked me to take a look at it and I believed that I'll learn setting it up since it has all the documentation to setup and I assigned it to myself

@MarkEWaite currently I am discussing this with Ulli Hafner(Reporter of this issue) on JIRA
If there is any other good first issue, please send me the link, so in case if I cannot work on the current one, then I can start on the next
27/12/2022, 20:18:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Subzer0570 you're welcome to continue the work on the CrowdIn connection for the warnings-ng plugin, though @halkeye is correct that the integration cannot be completed without the help of a plugin maintainer.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/ is the top level entry point in the documentation.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/translating-plugins/ shows the user interface for the translators as they provide the translations into their native language.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/crowdin-integration/ describes how to configure a new CrowdIn project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40H0bqGRiL4 is the recording of the Jenkins Online Meetup where @notmyfault1:matrix.org  illustrated how it works for developers and how it works for maintainers.

For a general overview of internationalization and localization alternatives in Jenkins, see https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/internationalization/
27/12/2022, 20:28:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Subzer0570 if you don't mind that the "first issue" has several different complications and may not have easy answers to all aspects of the issue, you could take https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-43052 in the git plugin.  I believe there are several steps that could be taken in that case, with each step being a pull request:

1. Warn to the build log when "Check out to a sub-directory" is used in a Pipeline job.  The challenge there is finding the correct location and determining that the currently running job is a Pipeline job and not a freestyle or matrix job
2. Find a way to hide the "Check out to a sub-directory" from the Pipeline Snippet Syntax Generator page so that Pipeline users don't see it presented as an option when they are using the snippet generator.  The challenge here will require learning more about Jelly as used in Jenkins and how to decide if a jelly page is being displayed inside the Pipeline Snippet Syntax Generator or somewhere else.

If you prefer to work on a series of pull requests, you could use the "Improve a plugin" tutorial at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/ to improve the clone workspace scm plugin at https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-clone-workspace-scm-plugin
27/12/2022, 20:30:57 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you'd like to be more involved in a deeper dive into a plugin that is related to one of the project ideas, you could help with the diagnosis of the test failure in the gitlab plugin pull request https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/pull/1375
27/12/2022, 21:47:12 - NotMyFault (Alexander Brandes): If you need help with the docs, just let me know :)
28/12/2022, 08:55:35 - Hrithik Goswami (batman005) joined the room
28/12/2022, 13:04:20 - Kris Stern: batman005 (Hrithik Goswami): A good start is probably going through the project ideas here https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ and start contributing via pull requests. 
28/12/2022, 13:05:36 - Kris Stern: We have also held a webinar to help you start and prepare for participation in December 2022 which can be accessed here at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_sTkGtTix8&ab_channel=Jenkins
28/12/2022, 13:07:16 - Kris Stern: And to get ideas about what issues to work on you can probably reference the guide we have for Hactoberfest 2022, which is still somewhat relevant: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#quick-start
28/12/2022, 19:44:36 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Hey everyone i was looking at this [issue](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-70142?jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened).  A thought popped in my mind , if the script generated by pipeline snippet generator closes the workspacei n which build is completed this will address the issue to some extent.
I would love to know your thoughts 
thanks for your time
28/12/2022, 23:58:46 - halkeye: should https://community.jenkins.io/t/new-to-open-source/5138 get moved to gsoc?  I'm putting it under contributing for now. Though it might be nice to have a canned/template response for this
29/12/2022, 06:07:36 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think it should be moved to GSoC.  I also think that we should have a canned response for that request
29/12/2022, 06:16:31 - halkeye: I wonder if chat gpt or someone here wants to make a response. I can convert a post to a template
29/12/2022, 16:41:13 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Looks like I actually read all the links you shared here previously, but sincerely thanks for sharing the links 
29/12/2022, 16:43:54 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): I'll look into this issue and with the PR you mentioned in the following message
29/12/2022, 18:15:06 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): I am trying to work on [this issue](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/WEBSITE-663) , however I would like to know : 
* Which acceptance criterion have been met in [this PR](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/2642)
* Which part of the PR needs work.
## So far:
* I have understood that :
*jenkins.io/participate is updated to reference https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/internationalization/  in "Translate"*  is a criterion that has been met. Please correct me if i am wrong.

PS : jenkinsio builds successfully in my PC.  

29/12/2022, 18:48:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, that looks enough to me.  The other acceptance criteria in that issue report seem to already be satisfied.
29/12/2022, 18:49:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There is more information in that wiki page, but the transformation of that additional information to pages on www.jenkins.io is not a "newcomer friendly" issue
30/12/2022, 02:13:42 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): In that case , I shall find a
 new "newbie-friendly" issue.
30/12/2022, 12:40:48 - pushker001 (pushker001): Hey, @MarkEWaite I want to work on this idea can you guide me in this?
30/12/2022, 12:40:54 - pushker001 (pushker001): Screenshot Automation for Jenkins Docs 
30/12/2022, 15:55:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @pushker001 I don't have much more to offer than is already written in the project idea.  I assume it would use some form of web browser automation to open a series of Jenkins controller pages and would then take a screenshot of each of the pages that it opens.

30/12/2022, 21:09:58 - iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh): Hi, I am interested in mentoring the project [Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/).

30/12/2022, 21:59:02 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Welcome @iamrajiv .  Could you submit a pull request to that project that list you as a potential mentor?  https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/edit/master/content//projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool.adoc is the page that needs the addition
30/12/2022, 22:54:01 - iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh): Hey hi @MarkEWaite 
yeah, I did https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5853.

31/12/2022, 00:34:09 - NotMyFault (Alexander Brandes): A pretty high false positive rate 🤔
31/12/2022, 00:36:35 - halkeye: NotMyFault: I dunno. It's the default settings. Honestly it hasn't been a big deal. Level 1s don't get blocked much and it only takes a few min to get to level 1.

I've basic knowledge of Java, have worked with JDBC, AWT, SWING in past and also have some basic knowledge of DSA in Java.  I'm new to the open source and I want to participate in GSoC 2023. I want to contribute to Jenkins because it uses Java and I'm familiar with it. Can anyone here please guide me how can I get started with contributing to Jenkins? I only know that Jenkins is used in DevOps to automate things. But I really want to contribute to a organization who uses Java. So can anyone please guide me?

01/01/2023, 08:15:42 - halkeye: It shouldn't download it. It takes properties files and generates classes. I don't know how to do it in the ide. Plus the CLI would give you errors and stuff

yes please
01/01/2023, 08:57:06 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): I ran the commands for which you were getting failing builds and the build succeeded everytime
so you can re-clone the repo and after opening the project let intellij sync some dependencies it'll take roughly 5mins

01/01/2023, 11:16:46 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Nope , did you try deleting and cloning it again?
is it still not working even after that?

01/01/2023, 14:54:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you know the version of Jenkins that you installed, then you don't need to provide the path to the jenkins.war file.  Use the `--jenkins-version` argument and provide the version number.  A search of your file system should find `jenkins.war`.  If not, consult the homebrew documentation for the common locations where they place files
01/01/2023, 15:24:25 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): if it worked on gitpod then locally it can be some system conflict/error
01/01/2023, 21:22:31 - ilya2s: Happy new year Jenkins community!

My name is Ilyass El Ouazzani and I am a first year computer science student at Université de Montréal. I recently learned about the Jenkins project and am really excited to potentially contribute to it as part of GSoC

Before diving into Jenkins, I was wondering if there are any other tools (such as Docker) that I should learn about to build a strong foundation for working with Jenkins. I'm really interested in getting involved with the Jenkins community and contributing to the development of this amazing tool, and I want to make sure I have the right skills and knowledge to do so effectively.

And maybe a git diff or push ola branch of what changes you've made locally? It's really hard to follow along

02/01/2023, 07:46:58 - Kris Stern: ilya2s: It would be great if you could start by making some pull requests for some issues that need help with, for ideas of what issues you can work on you could perhaps get inspiration from say this page: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/. Even though Hacktoberfest 2022 has wrapped up the post can give you some ideas about where to start. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to let us know.

I read about [Exponential Backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) and [Jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter). as the project involves knowledge of how [Remoting](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting) works.

> Stretchable and shrinkable scope: If the intern is struggling, scope can be reduced to unification of the existing implementations, or merely implementing exponential backoff rather than exponential backoff and jitter. If the intern is doing better than expected, the scope can be expanded to writing a stress testing framework for the end result.

* https://github.com/jenkinsci - jenkinsci GitHub organization for Jenkins core, Jenkins plugins, and more
* https://github.com/jenkins-infra - jenkins-infra GitHub organization for Jenkins infra and documentation
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md - Contributing to Jenkins core

* https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ - Contributing by preparing for Google Summer of Code 2023
03/01/2023, 16:24:21 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Many plugins provide an easy location to begin your contributions.  For example:
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/port-allocator-plugin - port allocator plugin needs more steps from the "improve a plugin" tutorial
03/01/2023, 16:25:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Once someone has completed the "Improve a plugin tutorial" they could look at the much less structured steps that are included in the "Contributing to Open Source" document

04/01/2023, 13:15:25 - Kris Stern: Hi Asrk03 (Arnab Sarkar) Aankirz (Ankit Kiran) Welcome to the Jenkins community! For a start please take a look at the project ideas we currently have for GSoC 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/ 

Many of these are in draft form with details to be confirmed. For an introduction to how to contribute to the Jenkins community this article may be a good place to start, although Hacktoberfest 2022 has already passed many of the ideas in it are still relevant: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/
04/01/2023, 13:16:29 - Kris Stern: It would be good to see which ideas that interest you the most and start doing some research as well as contributing via pull requests to solve the relevant issues we have.

Good initiative to work on that ticket.
There is no obvious answer to your question. Getting a reply depends on the availability and awareness of people that can help you.
It also depends of what type of question and guidance you are looking for.
- you can always try to ask your question here. If it is simple we can help you in this channel. Otherwise we can point you to the right channel
- general (development) questions can be asked on the Jenkins Dev Mailing list
- Using the dedicated gitter channel is a good idea too (ex architectural questions)
- if stuck in coding (ex test not working as expected), it is a good idea to start a PR so that people have a better look at your code and intend
05/01/2023, 10:02:28 - ilya2s: Merci pour votre réponse mr. Jmm !
My question was 'CONTRIBUTION.md' readMe in the `/docs` directory. I had to struggle for a little bit to be able to Build the project and run it locally and I was wondering If I could update or add some details to the guide as my first contribution.

1 - The guide tells us to use `http://localhost:8080` to test the plugin locally. but in `/run/start jenkins.run.xml` which I guess is the run configurations maps to port 8085.
2 - in the same xml file I had to manually chage `jenkins.version` for it to run properly
05/01/2023, 10:05:20 - ilya2s: Is this something that needs to be adressed ? and if so can you please direct me towards the right ressources to do it

> I was wondering If I could update

As a principle, PLEASE DO ! Anyone can propose a PR so that it can be discussed by the Community.

Submit a pull request with your suggestion. Your experience as a newcomer is a treasure and helping those that will follow you has an exceptional value.
Advise: make sure to have a separate PR focusing on these documentation improvements. Don't piggyback on other changes (new feature, code change). The PR should have a single topic.

For a start I would recommend using this article as a guide to see how you can start contributing pull requests (PRs) to the Jenkins community: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/

Even though the post was originally designed for Hacktoberfest 2022, it can also serve as a guide about how to get started for GSoC. 

Also, I would suggest going over the project ideas we are currently developing for GSoC 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/

Choose one to three that interest(s) you the most, then start doing some research to understand the relevant concepts better. You will have more than three months to prepare for your proposal, so it may be just about the right time to prepare for it better. 

For more background reading, please see: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/. There you will be able to find many resources.

07/01/2023, 14:31:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're planning to work with Jenkins in development mode on Windows, you may find it much easier to download the war file and run it from a command prompt window or powershell window with `java -jar jenkins.war`.  The Windows installer is a good choice for people configuring a server that they will regularly use and that they will upgrade weekly or monthly with new releases.  It separates the permissions of the service from the user installing the service.  However, that separation may get in the way of a developer.

As far as I can tell, the problem was introduced by f2f7029ba9186bd532a27391b976ff41e503b384, a CSS change that was trying to improve the mobile browsing experience.  If you confirm that is the problem change, would you also be willing to submit a pull request that reverts that commit? 

Yes ,i'll be raising a PR revert the bad commit
07/01/2023, 15:15:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/#post-installation-setup-wizard is a link that shows the problem in Google Chrome on Windows

07/01/2023, 15:22:13 - Kris Stern: I think we could somehow disable horizontal scrolling for the mobile version while keeping the original behavior for the desktop version. Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh) How confident are you with CSS?
07/01/2023, 15:23:13 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Im pretty confident with css i was just checking it out the bad commit
i'll raise a PR in some time
07/01/2023, 15:23:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, if you know how to do that.  Unfortunately, I do not know how to do that.  I suspect that the addition of the iframe at width 100% is what caused the issue.  That addition of the iframe was required in order to resolve the problem in the pull request that Kevin Martens detected while testing https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5726

07/01/2023, 15:25:34 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): i think applying media queries can solve the issue without reverting the commit
07/01/2023, 15:26:34 - Kris Stern: Yeah, that sounds like it might work with media queries
07/01/2023, 15:34:08 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): That would be great, though my past experience with breaking changes to the site has lead me to generally revert the breaking change first, then allow a later commit to redo the reverted improvement in a better way.  If you can find a fix within the next 4-6 hours, then a fix is great.  If it takes more than that, then I'd rather revert first and have a new fix as a second commit later

However, the output shows that it was published to `https://rajiv.github.io/jenkins.io/master/index.html`, which is incorrect. This may cause an issue in the metadata of the website.

To fix the problem, I updated the Makefile to correctly retrieve my GitHub username and submitted a pull request for the changes.

I am thrilled to be a part of the Jenkins community. I have been a dedicated user of Jenkins for some time now and have indeed come to appreciate the value of automation in my projects. I am now excited to give back to this wonderful community by becoming a mentor for the upcoming Google Summer of Code.

As a former GSoC student at Dask in 2021 and a mentor at Joomla in 2022, I believe that Jenkins would be the perfect organization for me to continue my journey this year. Can someone kindly guide me on how to get in touch with the right person regarding this opportunity? I have gone through https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/ and https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/mentors/ and have some ideas to discuss.

14/01/2023, 14:06:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Chinni12102003 that message likely means that you are running git on Windows and you configured git to checkout with Windows style line termination (CR LF) while the plugin has an enforced code formatting convention that files should use the Unix style line termination (LF).  https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings describes it
14/01/2023, 14:30:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I've submitted https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/pull/512 to make the line termination configuration in the repository match the expectations of the code formatting convention of the repository.  If you'd like to test it, you could clone into a separate location with the command:
`git clone --branch=add-gitattributes-to-force-formatting --single https://github.com/MarkEWaite/plugin-installation-manager-tool.git`

That branch should pass tests on Windows (it does for me at least)

For a start I would recommend using this article as a guide to see how you can start contributing pull requests (PRs) to the Jenkins community: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/

Even though the post was originally designed for Hacktoberfest 2022, it can also serve as a guide about how to get started for GSoC.

Also, I would suggest going over the project ideas we are currently developing for GSoC 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/

Choose one to three that interest(s) you the most, then start doing some research to understand the relevant concepts better. You will have more than three months to prepare for your proposal, so it may be just about the right time to prepare for it better.

For more background reading, please see: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/. There you will be able to find many resources.

If you have any questions preparing please do post them here.

16/01/2023, 04:39:44 - Dheeraj: This is the repo where the project lives: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/
If you would like to run this project locally, the CONTIBUTING.adoc file is the best source to refer to.
16/01/2023, 04:43:03 - Dheeraj: The search query did not work for you because there's no "Health Scoring" plugin. What the project built (and is continuously building upon) is a tool (not a plugin) that calculates the Health Score of plugins.

That explains 0 search results when you tried to search for it in the plugins.jenkins.io site (which is a site dedicated to Jenkins plugins).

16/01/2023, 16:18:12 - Jmm: Hello Chinni12102003 (Chinni12102003) 
Indeed there is no repository for this as it is a completely new tool (with a lot of things that can be proposed).
In order to prepare and be in a good condition to prepare a powerful proposal, concentrate on learning how JCasC work and what configuration drift is. Build several test "benches". For this project, you should become an "expert" in Jenkins installation and configuration.
To learn about the contribution process, you can pick any beginner issue and use that to learn. Any issue in the JCasC domain is bonus.

And obviously, read the various advices earlier in this channel 😀

@jagrutitiw_twitter: Can you please share the full error log?

Even I was noticing some problems in compiling the project, what worked for me what setting the $JAVA_HOME variable (as Gavin suggested above) to point to SDK 17. And then I appended $JAVA_HOME variable to my $PATH variable (exact steps might differ in win11).
20/01/2023, 17:34:17 - Dheeraj: Thank you very much @smilingprogrammer for pointing this out. It seems that the .env.example has some invalid values, and needs to be updated.

The error you're seeing hints that the variable `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON=* 5 */2 * * * *` has an incorrect value (ref: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/.env.example). It has 7 characters instead of 6. As a workaround, please delete 1 `*` from the end of this string and try again. Does this help?

My JAVA_HOME does have Java 11 path.  I am using three JDKS. Java 8, Java 11 for work and Java 17 for open source development and Jenkins. 

Would env variables like JAVA_HOME17, JAVA_HOME11 do the job?

You were right about incorrect configuration of JAVA_HOME. Once I resolved that it worked smoothly.

I set up the env variable then started  ran `docker-compose up`. 

The image was pulled. 

How can I explore more of the plugin. Like in GSoC videos there was database and a lot of other parts Dheeraj had explained. Where should I start to explore?

Which plugin?

> Like in GSoC videos there was database and a lot of other parts Dheeraj had explained. Where should I start to explore?

You can use the env variable to interact with the database. Try this:
`$ psql $POSTGRES_DB -h $POSTGRES_HOST -U $POSTGRES_USER`
`# select * from plugins;`
`# select * from scores;`
lmk if this doesn't work.

Pardon me. I meant the tool.

I'm not sure about the "best" way to explore the *Plugin Health Scoring project*, I would rely on experts on this channel with far more experience than me to correct me if I'm wrong somewhere. But here's how I would do it:

Before diving into the code, it would be a good idea to understand the purpose of this project. When you're able to answer the "What" and "Why" of the project, it's a good idea to head on to understand the "How" of this project.

Maybe start by taking a "tour" of the repo? Look at the directory structure, and get a bird's view of the purpose of each directory and the kind of files living there. Then start by reading the code. `ProbeEngine.java` is one of the important files, so maybe try understanding its code (remember that it's totally fine if it doesn't make sense straight away). I found it helpful to check the history of a particular file on GitHub and go to the PR which introduced those changes. I try to understand the purpose of the changes done to a file, which helps me get more context. The PR's body would link to an issue, and please read that issue to get even more context.

Try to see the table entries inside the DB, it will make things clearer about the data we're collecting, which would further help you connect to the code well. From the frontend's perspective, explore the various endpoints this project offers and check out how (and from where) the data is getting populated there.

Out of dozens+ probes already implemented, pick the one that makes the most sense to you and try to read its code and see how it's getting processed by the Probe Engine. On that note, please remember: Debugger is your best friend. :)

24/01/2023, 17:48:13 - Jagruti: Thank you so much for a detailed explanation dheerajodha (Dheeraj Singh Jodha) 

Exploring a tool, understanding code is a daunting task. I will take one step and follow everything you have said.

How do i convert the keys, since i only have the downloded key and no 'original' or 'converted key'
25/01/2023, 05:38:36 - Dheeraj: The 'original' key is the downloaded key.
And as written above the command: `Then you need to convert the downloaded key with this command` If you run that command, the 'converted key' will get generated for you.
25/01/2023, 12:19:33 - smilingprogrammer (Oyewale Abdulsobur): Thanks for the help @dheerajodha

26/01/2023, 11:46:27 - Kris Stern: Hi AagamShah2314 (AagamShah)  My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins. Welcome to the Jenkins community! 
26/01/2023, 11:47:25 - Kris Stern: So which project(s) are you interested in preparing for a GSoC application for? 
26/01/2023, 15:38:46 - Kris Stern: I think if you are keen about a certain project you should definitely work on issues that are related to it, that would allow you to strategically plan for your GSoC application. Also note that you can apply for more than one and no more than three. So do plan accordingly. 
26/01/2023, 15:41:09 - Kris Stern: Another aspect of the application would be your interaction with the Jenkins community at large, like how you ask questions, respond to replies, these all will factor in when we consider each application internally as an org. 
26/01/2023, 15:50:13 - Jagruti: I am unable to decide which project to aim for. 

Whatever project I pick the codebase is too complex for me to understand. 

I  am hardly able to contribute test cases to any plugin without guidance. 
26/01/2023, 16:16:36 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I am trying to work on the project Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) drift detector . For which I have been learning Jenkins and JCasC in depth inorder to come up with features like Drift detection, Sensitive data handling,Multi-instance support .and Comparison of Jenkins configurations. I also tried to work on issues in JCasC domain , but a lot of them are related to K8s and cloud technologies like AWS/Azure which are topics that I have just started to learn. Please may I know whether it is a compulsion to know them perfectly. I also request the mentors to kindly suggest if there is any other better approach to go ahead with the project.
26/01/2023, 17:04:37 - Kris Stern: No worries Jagruti, I trust you will be able to gradually gain confidence and insights once you work on a codebase long enough, but it will take persistence. 
26/01/2023, 17:12:12 - Kris Stern: <@lakshmishreea122003-63a2fc776da0373984a0cb1c:gitter.im "I am trying to work on the proje..."> I would recommend starting by working on some issues in the issues tracker for the JCasC repo at: https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin. That perhaps is the most direct approach to become familiar with the JCasC plugin. 
26/01/2023, 17:15:03 - Kris Stern: And Jmm  is the potential lead mentor of that project, maybe he will have something to add as to the best approach to prepare for the project idea. 
26/01/2023, 17:15:42 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the reply .

26/01/2023, 19:20:14 - iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh): [Jagruti](https://matrix.to/#/@jagruti1:matrix.org), to make the projects more manageable, try dividing them into smaller, more manageable tasks. Additionally, begin with simpler tasks or test cases to build your understanding of the project before moving on to more complex components. It's important to take your time and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance if needed.

Essentially the idea is you first disable security, then delete the old account, and then create a new user
27/01/2023, 16:01:46 - Kris Stern: Yes, agree with iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh) especially regarding the tests part. The existing unit and integration tests probably tell you more than you need to know as a newcomer to the codebase.
27/01/2023, 16:02:56 - Kris Stern: You may need to adapt the exact codes needed depending on your OS
27/01/2023, 16:21:54 - Akarsh-14_gitlab (Akarsh-14):   Yes tried this but i dont have that option called use security  xml code in that file .
27/01/2023, 16:44:43 - Kris Stern: Akarsh-14_gitlab (Akarsh-14): May I ask how you are running your Jenkins instance?
27/01/2023, 16:50:08 - Kris Stern: If you are just starting out on Jenkins and are running it on Docker, it may be better to kill the instance and start afresh with a new container might not be a bad option. 
27/01/2023, 17:44:54 - Jagruti: Thank you for your kind words Kris Stern iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh) 

Jenkins community has always been supportive to me.

 
27/01/2023, 17:45:56 - Jagruti: As of now,
I have not started contributing to any Jenkins project that are a part of GSoC ideas.


27/01/2023, 17:46:38 - Jagruti: I am trying to contribute test cases to various plugins.

28/01/2023, 06:59:08 - Kris Stern: I think it also depends on whether you installed Jenkins as a WAR file or as an installation, the path will be different for each case

I have installed docker containers to run the tool.

How do I see the table entries here? In the docker bash? Login through the .env variables credentials?

I am thinking of using 'yrzr/gitlab-ce-arm64v8' instead for my mac. Should i modify docker-compose.yml with this image?
And in the readme file of /src/docker only some docker owned directories are mentioned (incomplete maybe). I set up these paths :
/srv/docker/gitlab/config
/srv/docker/gitlab/data
/srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab
/srv/docker/gitlab/logs
/srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql
/srv/docker/gitlab/redis
/srv/docker/jenkins

Currently, I am a sophomore taking courses in college in San Francisco, CA and planning to transfer to UCB. I am interested in CI/CD, which saves developers a lot of time in building and deploying. I think it has a big impact and helpful to software industry. That's the reason why I choose to join Jenkins community. Actually, I use Jenkins to build and deploy my projects for a year. But I know a few for open-source projects and communities, and I think it's diffcult for me to understand plenty of concepts there, like: license, community, issue, PR and something like that. But gradully, I understand more now. At this time, I know Jenkins will also participate in GSoC, which is a goods news to me to make some contributions to open-source projects.
For now, I am planning to participate in a idea called "Plugin Installation Manager Tool Improvements", and I am trying to finish some candidate ideas there.
I am happy to be here. Let's make Jenkins community better and better.
30/01/2023, 01:37:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @mukundsrinivasb look at PluginManager.java for the `getPluginDownloadUrl` method.  It calls `plugin.getUrl()`.  That seems like a good place to start

I'm setting up jenkins to kickstart contributions here. I'm facing an error while following this tutorial: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven/

While I'm adding the path to my locally cloned repository to `Repository URL` field under the Pipeline tab, the following error shows up:
```
Failed to connect to repository : Command "git ls-remote -h -- /Users/shreya/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app HEAD" returned status code 128:

stderr: fatal: '/Users/shreya/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

I've tried putting the path to Git executable in `Manage Jenkins>Global Tools Configuration>Git>Git Installations` as `/usr/bin/git` but this doesn't work
30/01/2023, 17:00:24 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the said repo is cloned and is a git repo, I've checked it
30/01/2023, 17:00:38 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I'm running jenkins through Docker
30/01/2023, 17:01:23 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): can anyone help me out here?
30/01/2023, 17:04:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The path you've provided is incorrect.  The path needs to be `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app` 
30/01/2023, 17:06:01 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): @MarkEWaite even changing the path shows the same error
30/01/2023, 17:08:07 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): also, just curious as to why would I be putting `/home` instead of  `/Users/<name>`, as we've to put the path to our locally cloned directory right?

the doc did mention about mapping to `/home` in the jenkins container, I didn't understand that properly
30/01/2023, 17:39:10 - Jiakuang He (Sam): If you use Docker to install Jenkins, you need to make sure the container inside can access to this path.
30/01/2023, 17:41:03 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): When you clone the repository on Windows it must be placed in the location that the tutorial says, `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\simple-java-maven-app` (replace `<your-username>` with your Windows user name.

The command line that starts the Jenkins container in the tutorial mounts the volume `--volume "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%":/home`.  That maps `C:\Users\<your-username>` to `/home` inside that Docker container
30/01/2023, 17:41:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): With that mapping `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app` is the path to the repository inside the running Jenkins container
30/01/2023, 17:47:49 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Right, @MarkEWaite, understood.

I'm on macOS, so that means `/Users/<your-username>` is mapped to `/home` in the jenkins container, did I get this right?
30/01/2023, 17:48:33 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): @jkhe:matrix.org
okay, let me try this out, not so sure how to do this
30/01/2023, 17:53:10 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Use the precise paths as listed in the tutorial for the platform that you're using. I'm a Windows and Linux user and I'm confident that the Windows and Linux instructions work.  I believe that a colleague of mine confirmed the macOS instructions work on his mac.
30/01/2023, 18:00:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): afaik I did follow the instructions, but just to be sure let me start from scratch again

We'd like to switch those tutorials to be defined with Docker compose and be as simple to start as `docker compose up -d`.  Haven't done that yet

1. Please post the complete error output. The error you've shown might be related to another error somewhere else in the output. I think that using https://gist.github.com/ for sharing build outputs would be helpful.

2. Can you mention all the steps you performed and the commands you ran? This helps us try it our on our end and see if we see the same issue.

31/01/2023, 12:17:48 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Hello!
this is Shreya Bhagat, an Undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (in my third year), India. Have been coding for a while though mostly in Golang and python, but I'm new to open source. Have done elementary Java though - wanted to ask how much of a hindrance can being a beginner in JAVA be for my application.

I have worked in projects similar to jenkins - link:  https://github.com/sdslabs/gasper (its a Platform as a Service (PaaS) used for deploying and managing applications) and it's command line tool: https://github.com/sdslabs/gctl

I've followed through the tutorials which you have provided and ig I understand the basics of Jenkins. Now to start contributing, is it necessary that I take up issues related to the GSoC 2023 project Idea I'd apply for? Or I could pick up anything which seems doable to me?
31/01/2023, 12:25:35 - Jmm: 
Hello and welcome to the Jenkins Community, yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat) 

> is it necessary that I take up issues related to the GSoC 2023 project Idea I'd apply for

It depends on how comfortable you feel with your general knowledge of Jenkins and how to contribute. I guess that you already looked at the various "build your Jenkins muscle" advises (and online webinar).

Doing a couple of generalistic issues will be a good warm-up to get to know the product, the actors, and the way we work here. Then start digging and learning the topic you are interested in. The better you prepare, the stronger your proposal will be, the higher your chances to be selected for this year's GSoC.

31/01/2023, 12:38:19 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Thank you so much for your reply @jmmeessen:matrix.org !
Right, understood.
Yes I went through the build your muscle exercises, and found that pretty helpful
I guess I missed the webinar, is there a recording link?

Could you please help me with where to begin contributing? I also aim to participate in GSOC 2023 from Jenkins.
31/01/2023, 13:41:54 - Kris Stern: Hi mchirag2002 (Chirag Mathur)! Sure, have you taken a look at the list of 2023 project ideas at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/? It is recommended to have at least a few PR for any Jenkins related repositories, so I would recommend you to pick one(s) that interests you the most. If you are really keen to get your GSoC proposal accepted by us and Google, I think it would be wise to select two projects and submit two separate proposals in the same application in late March. 
31/01/2023, 13:43:12 - Kris Stern: I wouldn't recommend the [Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/) to you because it became clear to us that it will involve a lot of frontend development work.

31/01/2023, 15:05:38 - Kris Stern: yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Please go ahead and work on a PR after indicating on the JIRA issue your intention of following it up. As there is a remark that this issue may be due to a JSONParser bug, the best patch would be some clever workaround if feasible.

https://gist.github.com/30af2103262ddd126b3519a2f1d6026b.git
But I have already created /var/jenkins_home/host_mnt/srv/docker/jenkins
thus not sure why I am getting this error?
And on running `mvn verify` build is successful(with some warnings) and on running `mvn hpi:run`jenkins is not starting giving error 404, while java application starts running.    
Any hints 😟
31/01/2023, 17:18:04 - Kris Stern: About the `mvn hpi:run`, have you made sure the global config is set properly?
31/01/2023, 17:20:48 - Kris Stern: Regarding Docker, have you made sure the folders at `/srv/docker/jenkins` and `/srv/docker/gitlab` (I would recommend changing these to something like`~/srv/docker/jenkins` and `~/srv/docker/gitlab\`) and make sure access is granted so that Docker can access these paths.
31/01/2023, 17:22:11 - Kris Stern: Since we are making our own Docker image based on a Dockerfile we have more freedom to choose the paths we want to use. And for macOS I think the HOME directory as the root directory would be more natural.

I think the relative path is relative from the home directory and not from user in the docker container. Then why are you suggesting that? I should be using absolute directories as working path in dockerfile. Anyways i tried what you said  and got this : ` ⠿ jenkins Warning                                                                                                                                                              4.0s

31/01/2023, 17:56:02 - Kris Stern: But the thing is if we use `/` as root for the `srv` directory it will not work with newer versions of macOS because of the new measures brought with System Integrity Protection (SIP)

Yes you are right but it would be more general to have the this path as only little things will be needed to change for running the plugin in macos thus helping the beginners who will be coming in later years to contribute.
31/01/2023, 18:12:59 - Kris Stern: Yeah, that's a valid consideration

See: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection

do you mean to say that due to apples sip even if user is granted root privilages still it will not be able to access /srv/? You are right,  its a bit drastic. I guess i will need to use the home directory.  Modifying home direcory files will not require root privilages so i think i will go forward with home directory. But the problem is osxfs on my docker :( I am also thinking of using /usr/local/srv to bypass osxfs issue but it will still require root privilages which is not a best practice to do.

The tutorial page https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/add-more-spotbugs-checks/#add-a-spotbugs-exclusions-file-if-needed tells you how to add an exclusion if needed.

If the exclusion is easy to fix or feels safe to fix (add a null pointer check, etc.), then you can fix it directly in the pull request.  If it is does not feel easy to fix or you do not have high confidence that the fix is exactly correct, then add the exclusion

@krisstern:matrix.org i created dockerfile because i wanted root privilages as i was accessing /srv but due to apple's sip i dropped the idea and instead used /users/ which does not require root access and thus no need of dockerfile.
02/02/2023, 17:37:50 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org as we are running jenkins and gitlab in an isolated container if we want to use an external postgres db,  we will need to configure the GitLab instance to connect to it by specifying the necessary environment variables, such as the database host, username, password, and port. Otherwise if we want to run a Postgres instance within the same Docker network, we would need to add a service to the docker-compose.yml file similar to the GitLab and Jenkins services and configure it to connect to the GitLab instance. To persist the data, we would also need to mount a volume for the Postgres service. I dont see any one of them implementedn in the code. What am i missing?
02/02/2023, 17:47:14 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): in the error logs of docker-gitlab this line - `execute[create gitlab postgresql user] (postgresql::standalone line 13) had an error` indicates that the command is executed inside the container that has a GitLab instance running and has access to the PostgreSQL database, thus creating a new user in the PostgreSQL database used by that GitLab instance.

03/02/2023, 13:36:39 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > Have you tried granting access to `docker` for the Postgres as well?

How to grant access to docker for postgres? I saw in the gitlab-docker logs that the username was root and password was `You didn't opt-in to print initial root password to STDOUT.`Nothing of this sort was mentioned in the Testing readme file of gitlab plugin. That is why i asked this question to clarify how was postgres used with gitlab :
> @krisstern:matrix.org as we are running jenkins and gitlab in an isolated container if we want to use an external postgres db,  we will need to configure the GitLab instance to connect to it by specifying the necessary environment variables, such as the database host, username, password, and port. Otherwise if we want to run a Postgres instance within the same Docker network, we would need to add a service to the docker-compose.yml file similar to the GitLab and Jenkins services and configure it to connect to the GitLab instance. To persist the data, we would also need to mount a volume for the Postgres service. I dont see any one of them implementedn in the code. What am i missing?


03/02/2023, 13:39:05 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): **In the process of figuring out how the `plugin-installation-manager-tool` works , I have learnt**
1. How to mount a local directory to the docker run process by using `docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/app --name devtest --rm -it --entrypoint bash jnks-plugin-tool`
2. How to pass the local file to the jenkins cli within docker by using `jenkins-plugin-cli --plugin-file plugins.yaml`. The output of this command is pasted here. 

**What I plan to do today (4/2/2023)**
1. Pass the `jenkins-plugin-cli -p git:4.8.2_CMT:file:///usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins/git-4.8.2_CMT.hpi` as mentioned in [this](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/365) P.R ...  and see what happens ; I intend to contribute to the same.
**What I want to learn**
1. Which files are looked by the program while processing `jenkins-plugin-cli -p git:4.8.2_CMT:file:///usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins/git-4.8.2_CMT.hpi`
03/02/2023, 13:40:09 - Kris Stern: That's strange, I started from a clean install then tried running first `mvn verify` then second `mvn test`, also using IntelliJ. But I have been unable to produce the error you saw.

/srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql has to be modified to /Users/username/srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql i guess for mac.

Thanks so much for checking in, I really appreciate it!

* https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/scores/zap (example of a low score)

05/02/2023, 14:32:02 - prathi-mani (Mani Prathi): Hi, I am willing to participate in gsoc2023, and i am interested in few projects but have some doubts 

1) Docker-based Jenkins quickstart examples (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/docker-compose-build/) i see jenkins image already in docker (https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins)  i want to understand better about the expected outcomes from the project if docker images already there.

2)Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/) in this project i understand that we need to build the jenkins.io website and related documentation, should we migrate the existing documentation or prepare them for the previous versions from scratch.
05/02/2023, 14:35:43 - Kris Stern: Hi prathi-mani (Mani Prathi) Thank you for your interest in participating in GSoC via Jenkins! My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins for GSoC. 
05/02/2023, 14:38:30 - Kris Stern: For your first question I would say the scope of the project is to rework some existing Docker-based Jenkins quickstart examples to make these more comprehensive and more accessible. And for this goal, we have from the project idea page:
> We could have a set of docker-compose files representing various types of Jenkins instances (simple Docker, Kubernetes, …).
05/02/2023, 14:41:06 - Kris Stern: For your second question, the building Jenkins.io with alternative tools project is to prepare us to replace a tool called Awestruck with a set of new tools like Antora and Gatsby, so in a sense we will e migrating the existing AsciiDoc files to the new codebase.

05/02/2023, 18:22:40 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): everything is working perfectly. It actually feels illigal as most of the issues were solved by you. I didnt do much 
05/02/2023, 19:05:03 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org i modified the readme file : `In order to test the plugin on different versions of `GitLab` and `Jenkins` you may want to use `Docker` containers.
# Quick test environment setup using Docker for Linux/amd64

An example docker-compose file is available at `gitlab-plugin/src/docker` which allows to set up instances of the latest `GitLab` and `Jenkins` versions for linux/amd64. 

If they don't already exist, create the following directories and make sure the user that Docker is running as owns them:
* /srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql
* /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab
* /srv/docker/gitlab/redis
* /srv/docker/jenkins

## Quick test environment setup using Docker for MacOS/arm64

You need to modify the example docker-compose file available at `gitlab-plugin/src/docker` to set up instances of the latest `GitLab` and `Jenkins` versions for MacOS/arm64. 

Due to Apple's System Integrity Protection, you need to use the home directory as a root for the new directories to be created.

In the `docker-compose.yml` file :
    1. Change the ports to 
      - '55580:80'
      - '55522:22'
      - '55443:443'
      as the browser may block the ports in original docker-compose file.
    2. Change the gitlab volumes to 
        `/Users/yourusername/srv/docker/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab`
        `/Users/yourusername/srv/docker/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab`
        `/Users/yourusername/srv/docker/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab`
    3. Change the jenkins volumes to 
        `/Users/yourusername/srv/docker/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home`
    4. In your Docker-Desktop go to `Settings > General > Choose file sharing   implementation for your containers` and switch to osxfs(Legacy). osxfs(Legacy) utilizes more resources of the system so make sure that the assigned resources are sufficient by going to `Settings > Resources` otherwise Docker-Desktop may go to forever start mode on Restarting.
    5. Add `shm_size: '5gb'`under gitlab services.

Now for both Linux/MacOS users to start the containers, run `docker-compose up -d` from the `docker` folder. If you have problems accessing the services in the containers, run `docker-compose up` by itself to see output from the services as they start.

## Access GitLab

To access `GitLab`, you first need to create a user - `root` with some password. To do so, follow the following steps :
    1. In the Gitlab containers terminal inside Docker Desktop, type `gitlab-rails console` and wait for atleast 5 minutes for the console to start. 
    2. Once the console is started successfully, type the following commands:
        a. `user = User.new(username: 'root', email: 'root@root.com', name: 'root', password: 'setyourown', password_confirmation: 'setyourown')`
        b. `user.skip_confirmation!` 
        c. `user.save!`
    3. Now, point your browser to `http://localhost:port` and log in with `root` as the username and `setyourown` as the password. Then create a user for Jenkins, impersonate that user, get its API key, set up test repos, etc. When creating webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs, use `http://jenkins:8080` as the base URL.


If you have trouble cloning a GitLab repository, it may be because you have a leftover host key from an SSH connection to a previous installation of GitLab in Docker. To troubleshoot, run `ssh -vT git@localhost -p port`.

## Access Jenkins

To see `Jenkins`, point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. Jenkins will be able to access GitLab at `http://gitlab`.

Note: you need to change the security settings in `Admin -> Settings -> Network -> Outbound Requests -> Allow requests to the local network from hooks and services` in order for local webhooks to work.

For more information on the supported `Jenkins` tags and how to configure the containers, visit https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/.

06/02/2023, 07:10:43 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The container images that are used in the Jenkins tutorials are painfully complex.  The tutorials require a Docker network definition, a Docker in Docker container, and the Jenkins controller.  Then, the tutorial does the undesirable thing of running jobs on the controller, using Docker in Docker to run the jobs.

The dream of the docker compose idea is to use docker compose to dramatically simplify / hide all the ugly configuration steps that are in https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-multibranch-pipeline-project/ and the other tutorials like it.  Instead of defining a network and two or three containers, I want to `docker-compose upo-d` in order to have a working tutorial.  I want that tutorial to have 0 executors configured on the controller and to use either ephemeral agents or static agents to do the work.

06/02/2023, 16:58:46 - Kris Stern: Sure, but I don't think you need to do it that way. To remove a file from `git` you can do something like `git rm file-name` I think 
06/02/2023, 17:26:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): When a PR looks like a mess (happens to all of us), the most common pattern is to correct the mess with later commits, push the later commits, and mention in the comments that you would like the PR to be "squash merged".  The "squash merge" will collapse all the mess into a single commit.  The plugin commit history then looks very tidy and the pull request retains the comments and the insights and the education from the journey to the final commit.

There is an alternate called "force push".  It is much less attractive because it displaces or loses comments in the pull request. Don't do a "force push".

The plugin commit history then looks very tidy and the pull request retains the comments and the insights and the education from the journey to the final commit.

Thanks @MarkEWaite. You guys are very supportive 🥹

06/02/2023, 18:22:40 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi, I am trying to build the 'Plugin Health Scoring' project locally on my PC. I am trying to run the command 'mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip' as written in the contribution guide but I am getting this error
06/02/2023, 18:25:43 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I am also getting a 'This app can't run on your PC' error every time I run this command. Is it a problem related to my machine or maybe I am doing something wrong
07/02/2023, 04:10:11 - Kris Stern: Hi MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal) I am seeing "Access is denied" when you tried to run the `yarn` command... Have you tried opening PowerShell as administrator before this step?
07/02/2023, 04:11:36 - Kris Stern: If needs be, you may want to run the command
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
after opening the PowerShell as administrator before running any `yarn` or `npm` commands. 
07/02/2023, 05:07:28 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org i deleted the docker compose and settings file and commited the changes you suggested. Can you squash merge the pr.
07/02/2023, 05:08:12 - Kris Stern: Let me review it first
07/02/2023, 05:08:37 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > Let me review it first

ya sure 
07/02/2023, 05:20:39 - Kris Stern: I think we will need to add back the deleted `docker-compose.yml` file, other than that it looks okay. 
07/02/2023, 05:21:58 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > I think we will need to add back the deleted `docker-compose.yml` file, other than that it looks okay.

why should we add docker-compose file again? Anyone who reads the readme file should be able to modify their own docker-compose file i guess
07/02/2023, 05:31:40 - Kris Stern: We are not supposed to delete the original `docker-comnpose.yml` file for users to use
07/02/2023, 05:32:06 - Kris Stern: The problem is you have deleted the entire file so there is no file to modify
07/02/2023, 06:08:20 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi Kris, thanks for the reply. I ran the command 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted' in powershell and then the mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip command also with admin privileges but all I am getting is errors
07/02/2023, 06:08:51 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I think I might have to install a linux vm and work there
07/02/2023, 06:55:33 - Kris Stern: Sure, whatever that works
07/02/2023, 07:19:22 - Kris Stern: If this does not work we may try to use gitpod: https://www.gitpod.io/
07/02/2023, 08:18:26 - Dheeraj: > then the mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip command also with admin privileges but all I am getting is errors

Maybe some different error than "Access is denied"?
I personally love working on Linux distros, things would be easier there for sure.
07/02/2023, 09:00:10 - prathi-mani (Mani Prathi): Thanks Mark for your insights.
07/02/2023, 13:09:45 - Kris Stern: In case you are experiencing difficulty adding a file to GitHub, try first create the file, then run:
```
git add <name of file>
```
And then commit and push the file to the same branch as before

07/02/2023, 13:13:53 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I tried to build the jenkins.io documentation site https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io in the centos7 virtual machine. I followed all the instructions in the contributing guide with all the latest versions installed. Although the commands were executed successfully, I encountered an error when accessing the site at localhost:4242. It says 'This site can’t be reached The web page at http://0.0.0.0:4242/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.'  I would be grateful if you could help me resolve this issue. 
07/02/2023, 13:14:23 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): [![jenkin.io-make run.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/dgyG/thumb/jenkin.io-make-run.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/dgyG/jenkin.io-make-run.png)
07/02/2023, 13:15:28 - Kris Stern: Did you view the site at http://localhost:4242?
07/02/2023, 13:15:40 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org can i use this messed up pr of mine to experiment with git and github things. I didnt think that git will be this confusing
07/02/2023, 13:16:00 - Kris Stern: Or did you try to view the site at http://0.0.0.0:4242?
07/02/2023, 13:16:33 - Kris Stern: No worries, it normally takes a couple tries before you get it right with Git and GitHub
07/02/2023, 13:18:03 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I tried both. In order to check I also tried  curl  http://localhost:4242 this showed up a lot of HTML content but not able to access the site 
07/02/2023, 13:18:09 - Kris Stern: 0.0.0.0 means the browser is listening "on every available network interface"
07/02/2023, 13:19:00 - Kris Stern: Could you tell me what commands you have ran in sequence to spin up an instance of the jenkins.io site?
07/02/2023, 13:21:35 - Kris Stern: Normally I would start by spinning up Docker Desktop (as I use a macOS laptop), then I would run the commands `make` then `make run` and have to wait for a few minutes before the website shows up at localhost:4242
07/02/2023, 13:24:42 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): 1- sudo yum install -y make curl docker  2-sudo systemctl start docker then sudo systemctl enable docker
3-git clone https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io.git
4- cd jenkins.io
5- make prepare
6- make         the second time that i repeated these steps I used make run instead of make 



07/02/2023, 13:28:54 - Kris Stern: I don't think you need to run `make prepare` in step 5 if you will run `make` in step 6. 
07/02/2023, 13:29:24 - Jmm: Just by curiosity and to understand your setup, you are trying to connect from the browser on your laptop into a virtualbox (?) running centos and inside it a docker container with the web server?
07/02/2023, 13:30:43 - Jmm: if this is the case, make sure that the ports are opened and properly "forwarded" at every "enclosure"
07/02/2023, 13:30:50 - Kris Stern: Yeah, your setup could be why the browser could not access the port
07/02/2023, 13:32:08 - Jmm: If my hunch is correct, check whether from within VirtualBox (?) you can connect to the webserver (with curl for instance)
07/02/2023, 13:33:01 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org when i commit the changes i should commit step by step so that commit history is clean and understandable. And when i go to `files changed ` tab and delete a file from there (which is what i did with docker-compose and settings which i accidently pushed with readme file) i actually deleted the original file. i thought i was deleting the files from my pr only and thus only readme file will be left in my pr to merge, which i guess was a wrong thing to do. What i actually want to do is, i want to understand how to contribute to an issue (#1400) by opening a pull request for that issue(but what actually happened is #1403 was opened seperate from the issue which i didnt wanted) and i didnt quite understand how can i delete the original files from the master repo, i am not the project maintainer?
07/02/2023, 13:34:08 - Kris Stern: You can delete a file it the repo via a PR

07/02/2023, 13:36:39 - Kris Stern: I think you are supposed to carry out additional steps like the ones described here: https://www.thegeekdiary.com/how-to-open-a-ports-in-centos-rhel-7/
07/02/2023, 13:40:05 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the suggestions, I will try using curl to see if I can connect to the webserver from within the virtual machine. I will also take a look at the steps described in the article for opening ports in CentOS7 and see if I need to carry out additional steps to access the site. Will try again.
07/02/2023, 13:45:07 - Jmm: Way to go ,lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A) . Wishing you success in your exploration.
A good way not to get lost in all these "matrioshkas" (aka russian puppets) is to make a drawing of these environments and map the ports and networks.
07/02/2023, 13:47:33 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > You can delete a file it the repo via a PR

do you mean i need to checkout to a new branch, create an empty file with the same name, commit the change, push the change to my forked repo and then make a pr?
07/02/2023, 13:49:23 - Kris Stern: No, just create a new file with the same name docker-compose.yml on the same branch and start from there
07/02/2023, 14:02:31 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thank you, Jmm

07/02/2023, 18:12:12 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): CentOS 7 is not a great choice for current development.  It is very old.  It delivers very, very old versions of key programs like `git` and `ssh`.  I believe it also defaults to blocking ports unless they are specifically opened.

If you are not too far into it, I'd consider using a different operating system version.  I (personally) look forward to the day in 2024 when the Jenkins project will drop all support for CentOS 7.
07/02/2023, 18:14:32 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The maintainer of the plugin health scoring project is definitely not using a Windows computer.  He may be interested in improvements that help it work better on Windows computers, but that's not the primary focus.  If you are interested in that project, then a Linux machine or running inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is probably a better choice.
07/02/2023, 18:22:40 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the advice. I have windows. Can you please suggest a good way to build the jenkins.io website locally. I am ready to learn if I am unaware of the new build process. I desire to know the most preferred way.
07/02/2023, 18:40:28 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're on Windows, then you could look at the Windows Subsystem for Linux.  I have Ubuntu 22.04 installed on my Windows computer in Windows Subsystem for Linux.  However, I do not develop content for the jenkins.io site in WSL.  I have a Linux computer that I use for that task.

Ohh! Then whats the practical use-case of draft pr's? I need reviews and a lot of them 😓
08/02/2023, 07:18:04 - Kris Stern: Draft PR is usually for contributors to work closely with maintainers or when they want other people to know they are working on an issue but the PR is not ready for review yet.

08/02/2023, 10:00:34 - Ulli Hafner: Yes, you don't need the GITHUB_APP_KEY. This key is required when you want to test GitHub checks (these are reported after a build from the warnings and coverage plugins)
08/02/2023, 16:13:27 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): thanks Ulli, Shreya and Sayantan
08/02/2023, 17:46:39 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Hi, when I run the command 'mvn spring-boot:run -Dskip.yarn -Dspring.profiles.active=dev', I get this error 'java.lang.RuntimeException: Driver org.postgresql.Driver claims to not accept jdbcUrl, jdbc:postgresql://${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}'

After some Googling I think it means that the environment variables are not set, but I have created a .env file at the root of the project and populated it with the necessary configuration

08/02/2023, 17:49:23 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/nVum/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/5ae59eb4d73408ce4f97890a/nVum/image.png)
08/02/2023, 18:28:41 - Kris Stern: Hi Sayantan,
Let me see if I can reproduce the issue you have encountered with my local setup...
08/02/2023, 18:37:46 - Kris Stern: Have you started `postgres` locally before you run the command?
08/02/2023, 18:38:14 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Yes I have
08/02/2023, 18:44:41 - Kris Stern: Funny, I got `BUILD SUCCESS` after following the instructions... 
08/02/2023, 18:45:51 - Kris Stern: I see you have changed the database name though, but I have just used the recommended name `postgres`
08/02/2023, 18:46:36 - Kris Stern: Maybe tried using `postgres` for the `POSTGRES_DB` instead?
08/02/2023, 18:47:28 - Kris Stern: So this is what I used:
```
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
## What is the name of the database to use
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
## Which username should the application use to connect to the database
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
## What is the password of the user to connect to the database
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres-s3cr3t

# Configuration for the GitHub App
## What is the ID of the GitHub App
GITHUB_APP_ID=token_example
## Where is the private key to be used to authenticate to the GitHub App
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=path-to-private-key
## The name of the organization or user where the GitHub App was installed
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_NAME=organization-or-username

# Configuration of the application schedulers
## Frequency the update-center content is fetched
## This means on the hour, every two hours
UPDATE_CENTER_CRON=0 0 */2 * * *
## Frequency the probes and scoring processed are executed
## This means every two hours, five minutes past the top of the hour
PROBE_ENGINE_CRON=0 5 */2 * * *
```

08/02/2023, 19:44:15 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I am using the Maven cli and I might have to export the variables to the terminal to make it work
08/02/2023, 19:56:36 - Kris Stern: Yes, I am using Docker Desktop and Maven version 3.8.7
08/02/2023, 19:59:04 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I am not using Docker just the cli
08/02/2023, 19:59:39 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I will have to figure out how to export the environment variables to terminal

I have raised this Pull request [#163](https://github.com/jenkinsci/embeddable-build-status-plugin/pull/163) and testDoText is failing i'm trying to get status code back from Jenkins API so i can assert that. I have already read through https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/handling-requests/json/ in the hopes of finding something but couldn't get my head around some things there. Can you suggest me if my approach is correct on that test or am i doing something wrong
Thanks for Your time
10/02/2023, 11:51:15 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): hello, I'm having a hard time figuring out as to which gsoc project should I start working on/exploring. I've written a few tests for plugins and have a bug fixing PR in progress. 

I tried plugin-health-scoring and plugin-installation-manager-tool to get started, I didn't get many beginner friendly issues there which I could solve. I'm utterly confused as to how to start? all these projects do seem intimidating to me too
10/02/2023, 13:46:24 - Kris Stern: Hi yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat) Have you tried the two issues with a `friendly` label in the `plugin-health-scoring` repo at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afriendly? If you are interested we can work on some PRs together, just let me know.
10/02/2023, 13:48:01 - Kris Stern: BTW there is one new issue for the https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool repo today at https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/529. It is more docs related though. 
10/02/2023, 13:48:40 - Kris Stern: Also we have open Docs hours where Mark will be present and he welcomes any questions related to GSoC. You are more than welcome to attend.

> Have you tried the two issues with a friendly label in the plugin-health-scoring repo at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afriendly? 

these two issues are already taken up by some other participants
10/02/2023, 14:16:07 - Kris Stern: We haven't heard from impact-factor yet since he last said he is interested on looking at the issue. If you are interested maybe you can ask him whether he is still working on it. Since there is no active PR submitted for the issue you can work on it I think. Otherwise it may take a long time for another contributor to come along and pick it up later.
10/02/2023, 14:18:15 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay let me try this issue then, thanks a ton, I was lost for a while :')

-I don't understand port 50000's use
-how do I remove the container from docker:dind automatically(--rm command in docker)
-how does ci.jenkins.io testing work? (it's mentioned that it's the main point of this project )

No, you are not too late to start for this year's edition of GSoC. In fact, the list of accepted and participating orgs will not be released until February 22nd. 
11/02/2023, 20:56:06 - Kris Stern: To begin I would suggest choosing a project planned for 2023 from the list on jenkins.io at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/, then contribute via code as described at https://www.jenkins.io/participate/. 
11/02/2023, 21:56:33 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Hello sir , thanks for the information,I am thinking to choose Building Android apps ,but i am well aware with only java still can i start with it ?

12/02/2023, 06:07:45 - Kris Stern: I think the first thing to do is to locate in the repo where to add the new code
12/02/2023, 06:11:38 - Kris Stern: So I would suggest we look in the [src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring directory](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring) to find out where the scores are located and where to put scheduling code for the hourly job to be carried out.

Recently, i have watched a video on docker and a video on kubernetes by kunal kushwaha on youtube and have installed them on my laptop(I am using ubuntu).
I wish to contribute to ```Gitlab plugin Modernisation ``` project (https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/gitlab-plugin-modernization/).

Can you please pinpoint me to what skills i should learn before starting with this?

12/02/2023, 15:47:37 - Kris Stern: Not a problem yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat) Good luck on your exam!
12/02/2023, 15:51:14 - Dneth04 (Nethra): I have chosen my project as android building but i have started with a good first issue and tried making some changes to the repo,i am finding it little confusing since this is my first project which i am looking into ……

I checked the issues of [remoting in JIRA](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-70553?filter=-4&jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20component%20%3D%20remoting%20order%20by%20created%20DESC) but im unable to understand the issues.
What should i do to get familiar with remoting?

That means your probe engine didn't run. Please set the PROBE_ENGINE_CRON env variable to some more frequent time (in the `.env.example` it uses the frequency: "every two hours, five minutes past the top of the hour")

can someone help me out here? how to supress a false positive SpotBug warning?
13/02/2023, 16:01:48 - Kris Stern: I think you will need to update either https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/test/resources/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/spotbugsXml.xml or https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/test/resources/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/findbugs/spotbugsXml.xml
13/02/2023, 16:03:32 - Kris Stern: Basically you will need to add a pattern to be excluded from the Spotbugs checks
13/02/2023, 16:04:18 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay lemme check this out
13/02/2023, 16:04:22 - Kris Stern: Hi Dneth04 (Nethra) No worries, which project have you been exploring? 
13/02/2023, 16:05:04 - Kris Stern: Okay, cool 
13/02/2023, 16:07:32 - Kris Stern: Though my understanding of it may not be very deep, basically docker-compose is kind of like an improved version of the Dockerfile at least in its usability and behaviour? 
13/02/2023, 16:11:44 - Kris Stern: I think the best way to approach this project is to actually go through the original examples and start to get a sense about how you may simplify things for the user. 
13/02/2023, 16:16:24 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): adding this tag over the code snippet there: `    @SuppressFBWarnings("NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH")` should work? 

taking cue from https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/13e438622940ea0029ec5615172d175b94bd5c04/src/main/java/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/findbugs/FindBugsParser.java#L43

13/02/2023, 16:24:51 - Kris Stern: I think what they have given in at [L43 of the FindBugsParser.java file](https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/main/java/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/findbugs/FindBugsParser.java#L43) is actually the section name `ClassFanOutComplexity`, but not the bug pattern, so your suggestion may not work. 
13/02/2023, 16:26:45 - Kris Stern: But you can try it first to find out for sure
13/02/2023, 16:30:35 - Ulli Hafner: > @SuppressFBWarnings("NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH")

Yes, this is the way to do. And add a `justification` as well.
13/02/2023, 16:30:53 - Ulli Hafner: You can run locally with `mvn verify`
13/02/2023, 16:32:21 - Kris Stern: Thanks Ulli Hafner for the correction

Port 50000 will be used when you have multiple agents. I think in this case we only have one agent in the same machine, so you don't need to worry about it. I guess we can have a separate section to explain more for multiple agents.

> how do I remove the container from docker:dind automatically(--rm command in docker)

You don't need to add the "--rm" command, it's completely fine for docker compose.

> how does ci.jenkins.io testing work?

Good question. I think I need to discuss more with other mentors before giving back the answer to you. Maybe you will need to update  the Jenkinsfile in here https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/Jenkinsfile . But, once again, I will let you know later.

> What should I do next

Thank you. You did well. Maybe, you can explore the Kubernetes too.
15/02/2023, 16:47:47 - Jmm: Docker-compose allows to define a multi-container environment. It defines how to build an image, create networks and automatic connection between containers, as well as storage.
See it as a meta-dockerfile. A very handy technology to learn and master: it allows to build complex test setups (front-end, back-end, database, etc)
The docker-compose documentation is well made.

20/02/2023, 15:26:07 - Kris Stern: Yup, so we will rebuild the documentation part (User Handbook and Developer Docs plus the rest) with Antora and the Blog with Gatsby with the "Alternate jenkins.io build tool(s)" project, but the first step must be the rebuilding of the User Documentation with versioning before the contributor moves on to the other parts of the project.

Gatsby will only be used for the blog, and not for the documentation which will be built using Antora. But it is true we may not need to use those Ruby `yaml` and `haml` files any more.

21/02/2023, 07:56:25 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: Isn't #1088 a pretty major issue as a basic functionality of using webhooks to trigger builds is unreliable. How are the users of this plugin even using this plugin with this buggy feature? Is this bug version specific?

21/02/2023, 16:49:52 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Yup! worked. Faced some errors in between like HTTP 404, 502 but after some trial and errors worked fine. Thanks
21/02/2023, 17:09:03 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Should we install officially jenikin in our computer to work with plugins?
21/02/2023, 17:18:59 - Aryanshrana (Aryansh Rana): Hi community, i only used jenkins once to make the build of my maven project,i want to ask what's next i have to do to be contributor?

21/02/2023, 18:23:09 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Hello people, I am stuck.I went through plugin installation requirements and installed java 11, Maven apache according to the latest versions. And i tried to folk a plugin code from the jenkin's github page and while forking the repository and running it on my gitpod browser i am getting errors !! i have inserted the error page .Can Anyone please help me out to figure this out?
21/02/2023, 19:36:54 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Kris Stern: Can u please help me solve this ?
21/02/2023, 20:44:51 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Dneth04 (Nethra):  you'll need to provide more details about the failure and preferably provide them as text in a GitHub gist or elsewhere.  I guessed that you might be trying to use Java 19, but the tests of that plugin pass with Java 19.  I guessed that you might be using Java 17, but the tests of the schedule build plugin pass with Java 17.  I know they pass with Java 11.  Something else is wrong in that environment and we'll need more info to know what it is
21/02/2023, 20:46:18 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/schedule-build-plugin/job/master/lastBuild/pipeline-graph/ shows that the plugin master branch is passing tests on Java 11 Linux and Java 17 Windows.

22/02/2023, 07:42:08 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: Gitlab is giving `taking too much time to respond (502)` almost evertime. This is slowing me down 😕 using an AMD64 image is a problem. and for some reason jenkins auto-exits.
22/02/2023, 07:48:03 - Kris Stern: Hi harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh) I meant to make this suggestion earlier, those the hours is limited for the free plan users, have you tried https://www.gitpod.io/?
22/02/2023, 08:01:24 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Hi harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap S..."> Which paid service are you talking about which has limited hours? And I haven't tried gitpod. Am I missing something here!
22/02/2023, 08:01:53 - Kris Stern: I meant Gitpod
22/02/2023, 08:02:02 - Kris Stern: They have free as well as paid plans

22/02/2023, 08:03:56 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): and still gitlab is very slow, either error 500 or 502. Sometimes it works and sometimes it won't. Unreliable!
22/02/2023, 08:04:18 - Kris Stern: I am suggesting you to use Gitpod

22/02/2023, 08:05:10 - Kris Stern: 👌
22/02/2023, 08:09:04 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): isn't 50hrs/month less time. 
22/02/2023, 08:49:50 - Kris Stern: Yup, the free plan is currently 50 hours tops. But for open-source organisations we can get more. At least try it first to see if it works first. 
22/02/2023, 08:50:24 - Kris Stern: I will try and reproduce the errors you have encountered later.

22/02/2023, 09:25:22 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): thanks, the issue was solved
22/02/2023, 12:07:43 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: in issue #1088 it states that `We are triggering the Jenkins job from GitLab webhook, the webhook test works fine, but when the job is actually triggered by a GitLab push or note event, it will fail with HTTP 500 error.` When I try testing by pushing even then I am getting HTTP 500 most of the times. only once it happened that webhook gave HTTP 200 but then when I tried to push changes through actual gitlab instance, again got HTTP 500. Is this a bug or I am doing something wrong on my end?
22/02/2023, 12:44:18 - Kris Stern: Don't worry, let me check later tonight for you

22/02/2023, 13:13:22 - Aditya Rawat: I want to be a part of GSOC 2023.
 
Hello to the developers! In Jenkins. My name is Aditya Rawat. I am a B. Tech student currently in my Sophomore year. I saw the tech stack required to be part of Jenkins, and I can say I have learned HTML, CSS, JAVA, and last but not least JavaScript. I do have a good amount of knowledge about GO (Golang), Docker – Container, Kubernetes – Container Orchestrator, and Jenkins – CI/CD Pipeline.
 
Unfortunately, I saw the GSOC timeline today on 22, and I am here mailing you in hope of getting a chance or an opportunity to work with you all.
 
Regards,
Aditya Rawat
22/02/2023, 13:15:45 - Kris Stern: Hi Aditya Rawat No worries, we (Jenkins) have just been confirmed to have been accepted as a participating GSoC mentoring org, so you are not too late. 
22/02/2023, 13:17:01 - Kris Stern: You can still make a meaningful and significant pull request to bolster your application in addition to a reviewed (by us) project proposal (at most three is allowed per applicant). 
22/02/2023, 13:17:39 - Kris Stern: Do keep us in the loop which project idea(s) you are interested in working on so we can provide support where necessary. 
22/02/2023, 13:18:00 - Kris Stern: I am Kris one of the org admins for GSoC along side JMM and Alyssa BTW.

22/02/2023, 15:37:30 - Kris Stern: Hi Dneth04 (Nethra) So you are working on the [Schedule Build Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/schedule-build-plugin).
22/02/2023, 15:38:04 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Yes sir
22/02/2023, 15:38:37 - Kris Stern: I tried using Gitpod to reproduce your error but I got a Build Success instead
22/02/2023, 15:39:22 - Dneth04 (Nethra): oh But then i am not sure whats causing error in my system
22/02/2023, 15:39:51 - Kris Stern: Screenshot 2023-02-22 at 10.36.49 PM.png (Media omitted)
22/02/2023, 15:39:58 - Kris Stern: Could you tell me the configuration you have used for your Gitpod setup?
22/02/2023, 15:42:14 - Kris Stern: Or how did you start up the instance? Did you create a workspace on Gitpod first at https://gitpod.io/workspaces? 
22/02/2023, 15:43:27 - Dneth04 (Nethra): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Could you tell me the configurat..."> the configuration of gitpod ? actually i am using it as a browser extension
22/02/2023, 15:43:53 - Kris Stern: Could be why you had issues connecting with Gitpod

22/02/2023, 15:47:44 - Kris Stern: Try starting by creating a workspace on Gitpod then choose the suitable editor and setup for the build. I am using Jetbrains Gateway BTW. 
22/02/2023, 15:48:47 - Dneth04 (Nethra): oh ok will try it now

22/02/2023, 16:19:55 - Kris Stern: You don't have to start it up via the client. Once you "spin up" your workspace on Gitpod your client will be automatically started if you choose Jetbrains IntelliJ as the code editor of choice.
22/02/2023, 16:23:35 - Kris Stern: Hi Rohit Naidu Welcome to the Jenkins community! I am one of the org admins for GSoC along side JMM and Alyssa. 
22/02/2023, 16:25:16 - Kris Stern: Hi Aryanshrana (Aryansh Rana) It would be great if you could find an issue in the GitHub issue tracker for the [Jenkins Configuration as Code (a.k.a. JCasC) Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin), which is closely related to the project idea you have chosen. 
22/02/2023, 16:26:03 - Dneth04 (Nethra): oh okay will try that 
22/02/2023, 16:27:29 - Kris Stern: If you would like to work on something related to web development for Jenkins we have the [Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/) project idea, amongst others.

22/02/2023, 17:12:40 - Dneth04 (Nethra): I have got this, but i did not get any info called "BUILD SUCCESSFULL" but i suppose this has no errors. Also, the jet brains account asked for free trail while 'logging in' to get the active license. So, will I not be able to work in this once the free trial ends?
22/02/2023, 17:14:33 - Kris Stern: If you are a student you could get a free JetBrains license https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
22/02/2023, 17:16:02 - Kris Stern: If you run `mvn hpi:run` at the same or different terminal window on the IDE and follow the instructions to click on a button to open the browser, you should be able to go to the Jenkins instance with some additional click to be re-directed to the path `/jenkins`.
22/02/2023, 17:18:18 - Dneth04 (Nethra): <@krisstern:matrix.org "If you are a student you could g..."> Oh okay thanks for the information And also thanks a lot for solving the issue.👍️

22/02/2023, 21:00:41 - Kris Stern: But the thing is that you are not supposed to use `root` for the remote setup. You will need to create a new user like the `krisstern42` in my setup shown in the screenshot above.  
22/02/2023, 21:03:27 - Kris Stern: For GitLab servers hosted locally with Docker, we have to use the SSH protocol, can no longer use HTTP or HTTPS

22/02/2023, 21:36:59 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): to trigger jenkins job
22/02/2023, 21:37:08 - Kris Stern: I see...
22/02/2023, 21:37:27 - Kris Stern: I will have some time tomorrow to test more, will get back to you later
22/02/2023, 21:38:17 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): when code is pushed in gitlab, a job is triggered thats why we are establishing connection between Jenkins and gitlab using webhooks
22/02/2023, 21:38:56 - Kris Stern: Yes, that's true, but I would like to know what your exact situation is
22/02/2023, 21:39:08 - Kris Stern: You have not provided the full picture, that's why all the questions

I was trying to get my hands dirty on issue #1088. got stuck as gitlab started throwing http 5xx error. `gitlab took too much time to repond` is now a nightmare for me!

yup! was trying yo reproduce the error.
22/02/2023, 21:48:37 - Kris Stern: Cool, maybe meanwhile you should try more creative ways to troubleshoot the problem. 
22/02/2023, 21:48:43 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): actually I am using ngrok to expose my localhost and using https instead of ssh
22/02/2023, 21:49:00 - Kris Stern: I see
22/02/2023, 21:52:09 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Cool, maybe meanwhile you should..."> I tried understanding the gitlab-plugin codebase. I will see `AbstractWebHookTriggerHandler class` if I am able to reproduce the error.
22/02/2023, 21:55:34 - Kris Stern: Yeah, we know that the bug should be around the line at https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/blob/45c3881afe0341e9f9d8c0b55472aab5cc72b11e/src/main/java/com/dabsquared/gitlabjenkins/trigger/handler/AbstractWebHookTriggerHandler.java#L64. 
22/02/2023, 21:55:53 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): And is the issue #1088 version specific. I am asking because it's a pretty major issue if it is in all versions of gitlab. if users of plugin are not able to trigger jobs using webhooks then plugin is not much useful
22/02/2023, 21:58:12 - Kris Stern: I think even though the reporter of the bug has specified versions for the setup the bug crops up in all platforms, since we have no guard in place against this NullPointerException. I have an idea how to fix it too and it should be quite straightforward.
22/02/2023, 21:58:10 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Yeah, we know that the bug shoul..."> oh wow! thanks for the hint.

22/02/2023, 22:00:43 - Kris Stern: harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Remember to indicate your intention of working on the issue by writing something like "I am interested in working on this" on the issue, otherwise someone else might take it.

But these make many assumptions on the knowledge of the user and tends to be complicated, and we would like to have a set of simple and easy-to-follow docker-compose files representing various types of Jenkins instances in the form of examples.

I am Giridharan, hope you're doing well. I would like to help with the Jenkins screenshot automation project, I have quite a bit of experience with Jenkins and I'm eager to assist by creating and automating screenshots.

If there's a way for me to join this project or if there are any specific requirements I need to meet, please let me know. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
23/02/2023, 14:16:26 - Kris Stern: Hi Giridharan002 (Giridharan002) Welcome to the Jenkins community! The lead potential mentor for the Screenshot Automation project Mark Waite is currently  away but should be back after a couple of days / next week. He will be the best person to answer any questions you may have for the project if you have them later.

23/02/2023, 14:29:37 - Kris Stern: This is sensitive information and we do not have such details from Google 
23/02/2023, 14:30:39 - Kris Stern: It really depends on the strength of the proposals submitted for a particular org. We will not know until the results are announced by Google.

23/02/2023, 14:35:23 - Kris Stern: I know it may sound kind of contradictory of what I am saying, but just would like to bring up the importance of etiquette in open-source communications, which may vary slightly from org to org.

23/02/2023, 15:04:35 - Kris Stern: No worries, we understand. Try picking a project idea or two to work on in our [project ideas list](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/). Then work out a strategy for enabling yourself to submit a relevant pull request or two to improve your chances of getting selected.

23/02/2023, 15:26:52 - Kris Stern: Yup, that's the idea
23/02/2023, 15:32:04 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Yup, that's the idea"> thats interesting. when I tried testing the webhook then also jenkins was exiting. so jenkins is giving npe during testing also for me at least(have you tried webhooks ?) in issue #1088, he said `We are triggering the Jenkins job from GitLab webhook, the webhook test works fine, but when the job is actually triggered by a GitLab push or note event, it will fail with HTTP 500 error.`which means wehook testing is working. need to understand this problem well. interesting 🤓
23/02/2023, 15:33:40 - Kris Stern: Yup, actually you can tell from the code level some "guard" against the NPE is missing... I will leave it up to you to work out the patch as a challenge
23/02/2023, 15:34:20 - Kris Stern: You may or may not need to update the Spotbugs settings for the repo as well to pass all the CI checks

Thank you to all that attended the GSoC Office Hours. Because of the many questions that were discussed during the 1 hour meeting, we didn't manage to go into the  detailed description/discussion of the project ideas.
I'll discuss with the mentors to come to an efficient solution and will come back here.

25/02/2023, 08:36:06 - tokaygeckot: Hi all,

I was searching for some research based implementation project and found- **Exponential backoff and jitter for agent reconnections** interesting. Have gone through the AWS blog and seems a good fit to work based on my interest.
Have decent amount of past experience working in Java.

I have done setup of Jenkins repo in local(had faced some minor issues but got resolved), trying to understand code flow now.
As a starter, can you please help me with pointing tips/ basic architecture to understand code flow.
Thanks
25/02/2023, 08:49:37 - lper1582 (Loghi Perinpanayagam): Hi tokaygeckot ,
For those people who are interested in Jenkins agent reconnection architecture, I would suggest this https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-agents/ as a starting point to play around with the agent - controller communication. It will be easy to pick up the underlying problem around reconnection.

If more interested, you can find the swarm plugin here https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm/https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm/ and can go through the code for existing implementation on how retry is handled there. I believe this will be helpful for the question.
Thank you.

25/02/2023, 20:22:34 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): btw, sorry for disappointing you. I read on stack overflow that using try-catch exception handling is generally not a good practice thats why asked you in previous issue whether I should use try-catch or not. you said yes if it passes all ci tests. thus I did so. now while solving this issue, I again asked because I thought maybe you could point me towards a better solution. I didnt want to assume things and just push a pr you know. I am a beginner, thus I want to learn, so I am asking questions even if it's the stupidest one. Regarding selection in gsoc, I am contributing because I want to have some real world experience and fill my knowledge gaps. it's very much fine for me if I dont get selected. my purpose of learning is getting fulfilled by contributing to jenkins and I will contribute till I become capable of making some major contributions in java. after that I will switch to some other organisation to contribute in go.

You may try alternative approach to try-catch but it may not work as intended.

26/02/2023, 09:08:00 - Kris Stern: Hi daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas) Do you mean this plugin?: https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool Or is it something different?
26/02/2023, 09:09:33 - Mukund B Srinivas: <@krisstern:matrix.org "Hi daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Sr..."> Yes , that's the one 
26/02/2023, 09:12:36 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Using print statements to debug means writing `System.out.println("This Method is doing this");`
and
`System.out.println("This Method is doing that");`
this helps in debugging because you see what things executed correctly and what did not. This helps you to understand the flow of execution.
You can also print values used in a function that would also be very insightful

I am Dipanshu and I am delighted to know that our community has been chosen for Google Summer of Code 2023. This achievement is a result of the dedicated efforts put in by the members of our community.

After carefully reviewing the [Projects Idea List](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/) for this year, I have identified three projects that align with my relevant experience and skills.

1. [GitLab Plugin Modernization](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/gitlab-plugin-modernization/) : I've worked on  [test-results-analyzer](https://github.com/jenkinsci/test-results-analyzer-plugin) plugins and helped it modernize by merging multiple PR's.

2. [Add probes to "Plugin Health Score"](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/add-probes-to-plugin-health-score/)

3. [Displaying of Plugin Health Scores](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/displaying_plugin_health_scores/)


I have been following the progress of the [Plugin Health Scoring system](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/project-ideas/plugin-health-scoring-system/) project completed during the previous year's Google Summer of Code. The project was successfully completed by Dheeraj , who acted as a valuable contributor, under the guidance of MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) .


**I found myself in a state of confusion regarding the selection of a project to start contributing. Additionally, I am uncertain whether a contributor is allowed to apply for multiple projects from the same organization. It would be highly appreciated if someone could assist me in narrowing down my options and help me find some resources to get started.**

And this project uses java, docker and GitLab but I am not aware of docker and GitLab. So far I have just done java little in deep, I have understood the project description, but I am not able to figure out or solve issues from GitHub relating to this project. I am not sure how to proceed with it . What step should I take forward so that it can help me understand basic issues under good first issue ? 
Should I first learn docker and GitLab then go for contribution ?

> It would be highly appreciated if someone could assist me in narrowing down my options.

I don't know how others would tackle this scenario but if I were you, I would read (and re-read) the project idea page of all the above 3 projects that you've mentioned. And my main aim would be to understand the scope of the project and see what are the expected deliverables.

It can be possible that you might not completely understand the scope or expected deliverables of a project idea. So, you can ask clarifying questions to the project mentors on this channel or on the project-specific channel (if it exists). By asking clarifying questions, you'd be able to understand what is expected from the candidate and what you would need to accomplish by the end of the summer. At this stage, your focus should be on analyzing the projects.

After getting an understanding of the scope and deliverables, you'd be in a better position to judge whether you'll be able to deliver the project by the end of summer or not. I would look at the tech stacks mentioned on the project and see how comfortable I'm with those (btw you need not know everything upfront), I would also look at which projects am I able to understand more than the others, and I would also look at which project interests me more (very important), and accordingly rank the project ideas. At this stage, your focus should be on analyzing yourself.

After you've ranked the project ideas, it is totally up to you to decide the total number of proposals you'd want to write and submit, (FYI: the upper limit is 3). So, based on how far is the deadline and how quickly I will be able to write a strong proposal, I would pick the number of proposals. You can keep all of your eggs in one basket or put them in different ones, up to you.

Does this help?

> help me find some resources to get started.

this depends on the project idea. As far as projects 2 & 3 are concerned, I would suggest you set up the plugin health scoring project's development environment locally. Check whether you're able to see the probe engine running and whether scores are getting generated and listed on the UI or not, and try to run the already-written tests. Read the code and understand how are things working, from where is the data getting fetched, processed, and then stored. Check out the "Issues" section of the project repository and you'll be able to find some open issues that you can contribute to. I think we need to work on creating some more beginner-friendly tasks but feel free to join the https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/GSoC-Plugin_Health_Score channel to ask for help. But remember, at this point, your main focus should be on working on your proposal, because submitting and getting your PRs merged is a very nice thing but not more important than writing your proposal.

I have experience with tool you mentioned Antora  and DevOps tools such as  Version Control Tool: Git (GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket)

 Build Tool: Maven

 Continuous Integration Tool: Jenkins

  Configuration Management Tool: Chef                                                                                              5. Configuration Management Tool: Puppet                           i would like to know that are we restricted to use Antora only in our project?
27/02/2023, 22:19:22 - Jmm: Welcome Anshuman Shukla 
A lot of activity around this project idea happens in the GSoC-Plugin-Health-Score channel.
Also worth to note is that we are having a special meeting on that topic tomorrow. See https://community.jenkins.io/t/gsoc-project-ideas-presentation-plugin-health-score-probes-and-plugin-health-score-visualisation/5990
27/02/2023, 23:25:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Antora is strongly preferred because the Jenkins documentation is written in Asciidoc and Antora is a well-maintained tool that generates web sites from Asciidoc.  Other tools are much less likely to be accepted because after Google Summer of Code completes, we assume that existing maintainers will need to improve and modify the implementation.
28/02/2023, 05:58:21 - Kris Stern: Hi tokaygeckot Did you use your private key or public key for the key configuration?

I totally agree with ideas of analyzing myself and understanding the projects better. In the upcoming days I'll be working on the same and keep you updated 😊
28/02/2023, 07:58:39 - tokaygeckot: Hi Kris Stern ,
Using Ubuntu, generate key using `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key`
**private key** --> Jenkins Credentials (configuration same as snapshot)
**public key** --> docker agent (
```
docker run -d --rm --name=agent1 -p 22:22 \
-e "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=[your-public-key]" \
jenkins/ssh-agent:alpine
```
)
Is there a way to analyse and debug at what point it is going wrong, might be some misconfig from my end, I think.
28/02/2023, 07:58:50 - Kris Stern: tokaygeckot: Have you tried setting the Host Key Verification Strategy with Non verifying Verification Strategy?
28/02/2023, 07:59:53 - tokaygeckot: Nope, will give a shot on this too
28/02/2023, 08:00:29 - Kris Stern: Okay, cool
28/02/2023, 08:04:18 - tokaygeckot: Hi Kris Stern 
Same error
```
my-machine: Temporary failure in name resolution
SSH Connection failed with IOException: "my-machine: Temporary failure in name resolution", retrying in 15 seconds. There are 10 more retries left.
my-machine
```
28/02/2023, 08:06:01 - Kris Stern: I read somewhere for dealing with `Temporary failure in name resolution`, it would be worth to try restarting the docker service with something like

```
sudo service docker restart
```
28/02/2023, 09:13:44 - Kris Stern: Also tokaygeckot Can you show us how you pass in the public key during the step:
```
docker run -d --rm --name=agent1 -p 22:22 \
-e "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=[your-public-key]" \
jenkins/ssh-agent:alpine
```
Since it is a public key it should be safe to post it here. 
28/02/2023, 09:13:59 - Kris Stern: The syntax may be important
28/02/2023, 09:20:16 - Kris Stern: Or you could mask some parts of your public key with say like an `x` for security reasons but we will need to be able to see the syntax. 
28/02/2023, 10:28:24 - Anshuman Shukla (@anshuman-com:gitter.im): Okay Will join today for sure
28/02/2023, 12:30:51 - Muhammed Sabbah: Dears, Can anyone share zoom meeting link of today event https://community.jenkins.io/t/gsoc-project-ideas-presentation-plugin-health-score-probes-and-plugin-health-score-visualisation/5990 ?
28/02/2023, 13:05:24 - dhruvithakkar210: okay thank you !
28/02/2023, 13:31:21 - i-am-yuvi (Yuvraj Chhetri): Hey Kris Stern I am working on JCasC drift detector idea, I was thinking of getting the current jenkins configuration snapshot using the "ConfigurationSnapshot" class. After that we can parse the jcasc file(yaml) and then check the current & desired configuration states. What do you think?
28/02/2023, 13:34:38 - NotMyFault (Alexander Brandes): I edited the post to make the link clickable, thanks for notifying us!
28/02/2023, 13:34:54 - dhruvithakkar210: i have found a bug in this page can someone pls help me to find out this page in repo ?https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/
28/02/2023, 13:39:11 - Jmm: Hello dhruvithakkar210 
I think that this page is generated and then updated.
The best to discuss this is to raise the point in the docs gitter channel.
28/02/2023, 13:40:25 - Kris Stern: Hi i-am-yuvi (Yuvraj Chhetri) Is there any issue you are currently working on?
28/02/2023, 13:42:30 - i-am-yuvi (Yuvraj Chhetri): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Hi i-am-yuvi (Yuvraj Chhetri) Is..."> No, I'm currently not. Just figuring out how can I detect drift in current & desired state.
28/02/2023, 13:43:07 - Kris Stern: I think the architecture of the JCasC plugin is a bit more complicated than that though...

28/02/2023, 13:47:25 - tokaygeckot: Sure, will try this
28/02/2023, 13:47:31 - Kris Stern: There are spaces in your SSH public key so unless you put the quotation marks in the right places there could be problems
28/02/2023, 13:47:38 - Kris Stern: <@tokaygeckot:gitter.im "Sure, will try this"> Okay 👍️
28/02/2023, 13:48:23 - Kris Stern: Would be good if you could work on some issues to get to know the codebase better and ask more specific questions
28/02/2023, 13:48:32 - i-am-yuvi (Yuvraj Chhetri): Kris Stern: Any suggestions for me?
28/02/2023, 13:50:04 - Kris Stern: I would suggest working on some documentation-related issues first at https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/issues. Once you are more confident, try to fix some bugs. 
28/02/2023, 13:54:37 - dhruvithakkar210: <@jmmeessen:matrix.org "Hello dhruvithakkar210 "> thank you !

28/02/2023, 13:57:50 - Kris Stern: Hi dhruvithakkar210 I would suggested working more on non-documentation issue that are more relevant to the project idea you have chosen to work on to support your GSoC application, as there is roughly less than a month left before the application opens.  
28/02/2023, 14:06:06 - tokaygeckot: Hi Kris Stern , tried both combination "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY= ssh key" and "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY"="ssh key"
If I run `sudo docker container inspect agent1`
Env shows like this
```

Without "" , it was showing same too. I think some another issue is there. I'll explore if I can put debug pointer in code, where SSH is being verified.

28/02/2023, 14:08:46 - Kris Stern: Wait, I meant something like the following:
```
docker run -d --rm --name=agent1 -p 22:22 \

You can only have two quotation marks, and the JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY does not require any.

I have been overwhelmed for the last few weeks with my office work and I wasn't feeling well in the last weeks
I want to ask that is it too late for me to go for gsoc23 if I resume now?
I had raised few PRs in January. I have seen the draft projects for gsoc23
I am aware that contributor applications start from march 20. Can someone guide me on how can I catch up?
I would really appreciate


 
28/02/2023, 14:29:11 - Kris Stern: No worries, I think you are still on track
28/02/2023, 14:30:14 - Kris Stern: But do remember to share your proposal with us to proofread it for you as well as to make suggestions, it sometimes take us to review your work so would recommend sharing at least two weeks early. 
28/02/2023, 14:33:59 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Okay Kris Stern 
I'll pick one or two
I'll resume to solve issues related to project ideas.
Also I'll check the office hours video on YT.
Is there anything I missed ?
28/02/2023, 14:34:11 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Like some discussion or announcement
28/02/2023, 14:38:46 - tokaygeckot: Nope, whats dind ?

28/02/2023, 14:44:58 - Kris Stern: Another one will be on March 2nd and 7th respectively. 
28/02/2023, 14:47:12 - Kris Stern: I think it is the docker:dind (aka Docker In Docker) you needed when you first ran `docker run \ --name jenkins-docker \ --rm \ --detach \ --privileged \ --network jenkins \ --network-alias docker \ --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \ --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \ --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ --publish 2376:2376 \ docker:dind \ --storage-driver overlay2` on docker.

01/03/2023, 00:19:34 - Kris Stern: <@tokaygeckot:gitter.im "Little progress, changed to host..."> This is actually a huge improvement
01/03/2023, 00:32:20 - Kris Stern: And, how did you enter your private key? Was it via choosing a file on your machine? If so make sure the permissions are correctly set. You can try something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45877135/9959070
01/03/2023, 00:33:20 - Kris Stern: I am saying this because I see `ERROR: Server rejected the 1 private key(s) for jenkins (credentialId:jenkins/method:publickey)` in your stack trace.

01/03/2023, 10:29:17 - MsAkiNom: Hello, I am not able to join the room of this project, https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/screenshot-automation/, I believe the gitter room is not the correct one which is on the site project atm? Help needed on this

In the mean time, use community.jenkins.io (more efficient as it has mail notifications for new messages and other gadgets...)
01/03/2023, 10:51:40 - MsAkiNom: So, I have chosen three projects for now where I would like to contribute.
1. https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/plugin-installation-manager-tool/
2. https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/screenshot-automation/
3. https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/buiilding-android-app/

For some of these projects mentioned above, i am unable to find the rooms on Gitter. I have only found for one - plugin-installation, and the rest are unknown. Does that mean I can ask any questions related to those projects in this room as well or will there be a separate group later on?
Thanks!
