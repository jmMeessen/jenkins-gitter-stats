03/11/2022, 04:45:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): See the suggestions at https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#where-to-contribute for good starter ideas.  See earlier responses in this channel for good places to learn more about Jenkins.  As you learn more, you'll likely find areas that interest you and areas that are less interesting.  As you discover your own interests, you'll find ways to contribute to Jenkins that also address your interests.
05/11/2022, 11:47:18 - Kris Stern: alyssat (Alyssat) Jmm MarkEWaite (Mark Waite) I am thinking maybe I should open a PR to update and expand the page at https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/gsoc/? Any ideas or suggestions of improvement from you guys?
05/11/2022, 11:50:37 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Good idea.  I think one update would be to add yourself @krisstern:matrix.org as an org admin and remove Oleg as a participant.
05/11/2022, 11:50:54 - Kris Stern: Okay, sure

09/11/2022, 15:31:20 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): When you has read it and you are still lost, you can look in here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin we still need support and few issues for beginners https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22.

15/11/2022, 15:18:43 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): Hi! I am interested to apply for Jenkins for GSoC 2023 
15/11/2022, 15:19:44 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): This is my GitHub ID https://github.com/Delta456 and I would like to know what I can work on when the program starts
15/11/2022, 15:21:26 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): whom I can take guidance from
15/11/2022, 15:32:29 - Jmm: Welcome Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal) 
15/11/2022, 15:33:05 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): It is announced https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/11/get-ready-for-google-summer-of-code-2023.html
15/11/2022, 15:33:43 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): > Welcome @Delta456 
15/11/2022, 15:34:08 - Jmm: There you go, Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal) . You are better informed than me. Thanks for sharing the link
15/11/2022, 15:34:39 - Jmm: We will organise (in January/Feb) an info-session on how to get best prepared for GSoC and present a strong submission. Stay tuned.
15/11/2022, 15:34:56 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): Thank you so much
15/11/2022, 15:35:07 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I assume you are gonna be our mentor for next year?
15/11/2022, 15:36:12 - Jmm: Being an Org Admin for Jenkins will be already plenty of work. But Org Admin as we understand it at Jenkins is also some sort of mentoring.
15/11/2022, 15:37:27 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I see
15/11/2022, 15:38:00 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I have experience with Python and Go, and a bit of C and C++ too. Hoping that would be enough.
15/11/2022, 15:39:10 - Jmm: Jenkins is mainly a Java application. 😐️
15/11/2022, 15:40:50 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I am ready to learn Java when needed.
15/11/2022, 15:42:32 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I will start learning it from today itself.
15/11/2022, 15:42:44 - Jmm: I like that. So start learning by selecting a couple of issues (simple first and than more challenging).
15/11/2022, 15:43:23 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): You mean of Jenkins or Java?
15/11/2022, 15:44:45 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): What Java version does Jenkins use?
15/11/2022, 15:45:43 - Jmm: I mean: learning java (and Jenkins) by picking up an issue, study the issue by reproducing it,  read other people's code, and propose a fix (in Java)
15/11/2022, 15:46:41 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): From now itself? Ok
15/11/2022, 15:47:31 - Jmm: Have a look at the developer documentation. Jenkins is currently qualified for Java 11 but we are moving at a fast pace to make it compatible with Java 17.
15/11/2022, 15:48:06 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I see
15/11/2022, 15:48:24 - Delta456 (Swastik Baranwal): I will ask here when I have doubts or help is needed
15/11/2022, 16:05:40 - Jmm: For technical (programming) questions, you are better to ask on the developer mailing list. This channel is focusing on announcements and guidance about the GSoC program. 
15/11/2022, 17:10:14 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): When somebody has skills with object oriented languages like C++, then learn Java is not so big issue 😉
15/11/2022, 17:10:50 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): When you want start now (and do not wait for next summer) you can contribute on many plugins.
15/11/2022, 18:54:36 - anurag-sachan (Anurag Sachan): @jmmeessen:matrix.org Hi Jmm, last time I applied to Jenkins for the first time and was new to community, now that I have some basic understanding of Java, Jenkins (majorly pipeline), maven, plugins & microservices, could you guide me on how to make quality contributions and understand production level projects as I recently got rejected for MLH but I want to learn & do not want to miss GSOC 2023 opportunity.
17/11/2022, 18:48:42 - Jmm: An important characteristic of working on Open Source is that we work in the open and that everything is shared. People that participate to GSoC will learn and experiment this way of communicating and working.
17/11/2022, 18:52:42 - halkeye: 100% I will flat out ignore DMs (unless I know the person on a personal level) 
17/11/2022, 21:18:33 - vedant-z (Vedant Borkar): Hello everyone
17/11/2022, 21:19:24 - vedant-z (Vedant Borkar): I am Vedant. I love contributing to open source and have been contributing for a while. I want to also participate in GSOC 2023. 
17/11/2022, 21:20:24 - vedant-z (Vedant Borkar): So if anybody can guide me on how should I start it would be of great help.
17/11/2022, 21:20:27 - vedant-z (Vedant Borkar): Thanks
17/11/2022, 21:38:14 - Jmm: Although we are quite early in GSoC2023, a lot of members of this channel are wondering how is works, how  to prepare, and many other questions. 
17/11/2022, 23:48:06 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Hello , 
17/11/2022, 23:48:55 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Does Jenkins have any project based on spring boot ? Or just preferably focused over core Java 
17/11/2022, 23:52:10 - Ulli Hafner: No, we don't. Spring boot arrived after Jenkins was born. 
17/11/2022, 23:53:14 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): And also please suggest me the areas in the jenkin plugin where the Junit tests can be written means I want to start working on writting or improving tests for plugins where could I start ?
17/11/2022, 23:56:45 - Ulli Hafner: There is our list of open newbie friendly issues: https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly

19/11/2022, 17:29:13 - shraddha761 (shraddha761): can i start working on this project. I need some guidance on it. 
19/11/2022, 17:38:46 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Sure @shraddha761 .  https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin is a plugin that is looking for someone to adopt it.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/ is a tutorial of steps that can improve a plugin through a series of small, useful pull requests.  If that list is complete, then there is a Google Doc that lists many more ideas at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit#heading=h.hvd0nm6pz5o4

19/11/2022, 17:49:28 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): I understand what `declarative syntax` is. But I do not know what examples it speaks of? 
19/11/2022, 18:38:58 - halkeye: I would recommend looking into jenkins declarative syntax. It's a core part of pipelines and jenkins now.
19/11/2022, 19:47:08 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): @jagrutitiw_twitter hi. I
19/11/2022, 19:49:19 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Please get in contact with me in gitter or better post a comment in the issue. I think there is a test for declarative pipeline.  So you can grab the test code and bring it in readme file as well  😉 
19/11/2022, 19:51:06 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): Slowly is the file too big. So when you will bring more examples I will propose to create new examples.md file. 
19/11/2022, 19:52:49 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): So please write in the issue that you want do it and I will assign it to you. All of the discussions can be done there. And many thx for contributing 
20/11/2022, 05:12:25 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): I already have commented on the issue. 
20/11/2022, 05:15:34 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): Hey @mPokornyETM 
20/11/2022, 05:30:49 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): Hey @halkeye:g4v.dev
20/11/2022, 05:31:14 - jagrutitiw_twitter (Jagruti): Did you mean this documentation: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/
20/11/2022, 11:45:06 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): hey @MarkEWaite , do we have any document or guideline on How the Jenkins Docker image and Configuration as Code (CasC) work?
20/11/2022, 14:37:55 - mPokornyETM (mPokornyETM): https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/README.md#getting-started will helps you
20/11/2022, 15:00:33 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @iqbalrohail there are also various publicly visible examples of Jenkins implementations that use configuration as code with the Jenkins docker image to maintain the contents of the container.  @halkeye:g4v.dev has a repository that others have referenced previously (I don't recall the URL).  I have a "strange use case" repository that I use for rapid setup and teardown of test configurations.  Sam Gleske has a git repository that helps as well https://github.com/samrocketman/jenkins-bootstrap-shared
20/11/2022, 17:54:32 - adityagoyal200 (Aditya goyal): Hi I am new in this open-source environment and want to start contributing open source how can I start with open source
20/11/2022, 18:22:23 - Ulli Hafner: Please have a look at https://community.jenkins.io/t/i-need-contribution-guide-for-gsoc-2023/4555 and https://www.jenkins.io/participate/ 
20/11/2022, 19:24:02 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): In addition to the recommendation from Ulli Hafner, if you'd like a specific plugin that could use your help, look at https://github.com/jenkinsci/parameterized-trigger-plugin and follow the instructions in https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/ . When that is finished, you can see even more ideas for improvements in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit?usp=sharing
20/11/2022, 21:24:15 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Hey there everyone! I'm Pratik, I want to contribute to GSOC'23 through Jenkins. Don't know if this is the right channel to ask this question. My doubt is about the Jenkins codebase. I've reading through the codebase for the past couple of days and trying to figure out how everything works. What timeframe do you think is required to understand the whole or at least the most important parts of Jenkins backend? (I'm familiar with basics of conventional Java and have experience with developing android apps using Java) I'm new to the Jenkins community so extremely so sorry if this question sounds silly😅
20/11/2022, 21:26:10 - Jmm: Hello and welcome pratik2315 (pratik2315) 
20/11/2022, 21:27:07 - Jmm: To try to be a little more specific in my answer, it depends on how much time you can invest and if you are a quick learner.
20/11/2022, 21:29:06 - Jmm: There are several learning paths described higher in this thread. The advise on the GSoC and Hacktoberfest pages are also a very good start (and have several pointer to go further).
20/11/2022, 21:32:00 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Thanks for the detailed response @jmmeessen:matrix.org I'll go through the references you listed👍
20/11/2022, 21:32:12 - Jmm: And first of all, try to install Jenkins locally and play with it. It will be useful to understand the GSoC project proposal and (newbie)  issue description
20/11/2022, 21:43:34 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Makes sense. Got it👍
20/11/2022, 22:22:24 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): As @jmmeessen:matrix.org suggested to run Jenkins locally and play with it , it is also a plus point if you @pratik2315  start learning about Jenkins tool and have knowledge of ci/cd as currently I am doing the same to have good understanding of what actually Jenkins do ... Also I would suggest you to learn about junit to write improve  tests for various plugins 
20/11/2022, 22:24:39 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Seniors are requested to correct me if I am not right so I could improve myself too ...thanks
20/11/2022, 23:26:51 - pratik2315 (pratik2315): Thanks man @iqbalrohail i appreciate the help. I have worked with Junit before so that may be a plus😄
21/11/2022, 15:56:52 - iqbalrohail (Rohail Iqbal): Yes @pratik2315 it's good that you know junit , you can checkout some plugins and have a look on tests written in them . Check what you can do with them ...

15/12/2022, 12:34:04 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): Hello All , I have been working through  the [create a plugin tutorial](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial/create/) . However, ![I run into this error](https://imgur.com/a/e4OTgdG) . Till now, I have tried `mvn clean` and `mvn clean install` Commands. None of these seem to work. Therefore, I am working on all the suggested solutions [from](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45337558/failed-to-execute-goal-org-apache-maven-pluginsmaven-enforcer-plugin) . Shall keep all of you posted if I find a solution. I would also love some advice on the same.

15/12/2022, 12:49:13 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): `mvn clean install -Denforcer.skip=true` works , however, since I am new to maven and jenkins, I don't really know if they are the same thing.
15/12/2022, 13:04:09 - Ulli Hafner: The message indicates a problem in the pom.xml. It seems that some URLs are using HTTP and not HTTPS. So do not use `-Denforcer.skip=true`, better fix the problem!
15/12/2022, 13:08:26 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Whenever i get this error i check the java version in parent pom and use that jdk version. It works for me you can try it and also uske maven 3.8.6 it'll work fine 
15/12/2022, 13:40:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The maven version that you're using is too old.  You're using Apache Maven 3.6.3. 
15/12/2022, 16:25:26 - Dheeraj: Also, I find it helpful to look at the error messages to see if there's something I'm missing. In your screenshot, you can see the text:
18/12/2022, 09:17:29 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): All I had to do was upgrade maven and that worked wonders.. Thanks a lot 
19/12/2022, 12:55:33 - prak30 (prak30): Hi all I have successfull cloned and am running jenkins on my local system.Can someone guide me as to how I can start contributing to the project. Any pre-requisites before starting contribution tutorials etc. I was unable to find good first issues on github.

20/12/2022, 12:05:00 - Jmm: False alarm (and my bad): it is always a good idea to do a `make clean` (cleaning the work environment)  after a dependency change and if things don't work as expected).

21/12/2022, 09:17:09 - halkeye: Those 3 screenshots seem to say the same thing. And the error would be much higher up in the output 
21/12/2022, 09:49:34 - Jmm: Hi daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas) ,
21/12/2022, 10:50:16 - Ulli Hafner: Our https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/ page seems to be broken, the people images are too high, is this already known?
21/12/2022, 10:51:58 - Jmm: Oops. no, I am not aware of issues with that page (it is generated automatically). Looking into it (with a cleaned cache)
21/12/2022, 10:56:05 - Ulli Hafner sent an image. (Media omitted)
21/12/2022, 10:56:13 - Ulli Hafner: Hmm, seems to render not correctly in Safari. Chrome looks ok.
21/12/2022, 10:57:33 - Ulli Hafner: Even after cleaning the cache it remains this way...
21/12/2022, 10:57:37 - Jmm: Ulli Hafner: That is indeed ugly and broken 
21/12/2022, 10:58:12 - Ulli Hafner: Firefox is fine as well.
21/12/2022, 10:58:45 - Jmm: I only use Chrome as reference Web Browser. I will see if I can reproduce your glitch on my safari here.
21/12/2022, 11:00:05 - Jmm: The bug is confirmed: I have the same "uglyness" with my Safari
21/12/2022, 11:03:22 - Jmm: Will have a look how to fix this. This is the code used to generate the page: /content/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas.html.haml (probably a .css issue).Suggestion/correction is welcome
21/12/2022, 11:15:16 - Jmm: I have no clue where the mentor macro is defined. But I have only a very shallow knowledge of haml
21/12/2022, 11:16:13 - Jmm: I need help for this one
21/12/2022, 19:17:12 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): can you provide the complete stack trace?

22/12/2022, 00:35:08 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): For your own convenience, you should add your user account to the docker group so that you don't need to `sudo make all`.  
22/12/2022, 00:48:50 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're willing to push your local changes to a draft pull request on jenkins.io, it may be easier to deduce what's happening in the site generation process that is causing the failure.

25/12/2022, 18:15:55 - halkeye: Stuck or a lot of cpu? I think the build process is pretty heavy
25/12/2022, 18:17:15 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): i have waited many hours before when i used only `make` it also gets stuck 
25/12/2022, 18:19:55 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Oh it started again , sorry my bad
25/12/2022, 18:26:23 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): If after running `make user-site GITHUB_USERNAME=<USERNAME>` site is hosted on my fork of jenkins.io does it mean there's no failure after my changes?
25/12/2022, 18:35:29 - halkeye: I don't know if user site still work but it's supposed to create output that you can upload to GitHub.io pages. Lemme get out of bed and see what it does
25/12/2022, 19:01:03 - halkeye: oh yea it does publish
25/12/2022, 19:01:51 - halkeye: assuming it worked, it would have shown up at https://vandit1604.github.io/jenkins.io/ but you might need to enable github pages on that repo
25/12/2022, 19:02:06 - halkeye: do you need publish it? what are you trying to do?
25/12/2022, 19:02:21 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): yes it did i was testing my changes
25/12/2022, 19:03:03 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): so i thought if this works that means all tests passed
25/12/2022, 19:03:20 - halkeye: `make` by itself makes the site and puts it into build/_site/sitemap, then i use a static server (ex `python3 -m http.server`) to serve that directory and test it

27/12/2022, 04:22:22 - halkeye: i don't think those are things third parties can do, i think its one of the maintainers that has to set it all up, and want it setup. Warnings-ng is very heavily maintained. Is there a reason you picked that one to do ?
27/12/2022, 04:25:37 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): There is no specific reason to choose this issue, this was the first issue assgined to me and I was planning to atleast set crowdin for this project because I cannot do any translations

27/12/2022, 20:18:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Subzer0570 you're welcome to continue the work on the CrowdIn connection for the warnings-ng plugin, though @halkeye is correct that the integration cannot be completed without the help of a plugin maintainer.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/ is the top level entry point in the documentation.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/translating-plugins/ shows the user interface for the translators as they provide the translations into their native language.  https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/crowdin-integration/ describes how to configure a new CrowdIn project.
27/12/2022, 20:28:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Subzer0570 if you don't mind that the "first issue" has several different complications and may not have easy answers to all aspects of the issue, you could take https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-43052 in the git plugin.  I believe there are several steps that could be taken in that case, with each step being a pull request:
27/12/2022, 20:30:57 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you'd like to be more involved in a deeper dive into a plugin that is related to one of the project ideas, you could help with the diagnosis of the test failure in the gitlab plugin pull request https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin/pull/1375
27/12/2022, 21:47:12 - NotMyFault (Alexander Brandes): If you need help with the docs, just let me know :)
28/12/2022, 13:04:20 - Kris Stern: batman005 (Hrithik Goswami): A good start is probably going through the project ideas here https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ and start contributing via pull requests. 
28/12/2022, 13:05:36 - Kris Stern: We have also held a webinar to help you start and prepare for participation in December 2022 which can be accessed here at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_sTkGtTix8&ab_channel=Jenkins
28/12/2022, 13:07:16 - Kris Stern: And to get ideas about what issues to work on you can probably reference the guide we have for Hactoberfest 2022, which is still somewhat relevant: https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/#quick-start
28/12/2022, 19:44:36 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Hey everyone i was looking at this [issue](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-70142?jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened).  A thought popped in my mind , if the script generated by pipeline snippet generator closes the workspacei n which build is completed this will address the issue to some extent.
28/12/2022, 23:58:46 - halkeye: should https://community.jenkins.io/t/new-to-open-source/5138 get moved to gsoc?  I'm putting it under contributing for now. Though it might be nice to have a canned/template response for this
29/12/2022, 06:07:36 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think it should be moved to GSoC.  I also think that we should have a canned response for that request
29/12/2022, 06:16:31 - halkeye: I wonder if chat gpt or someone here wants to make a response. I can convert a post to a template
29/12/2022, 16:41:13 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Looks like I actually read all the links you shared here previously, but sincerely thanks for sharing the links

01/01/2023, 14:54:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you know the version of Jenkins that you installed, then you don't need to provide the path to the jenkins.war file.  Use the `--jenkins-version` argument and provide the version number.  A search of your file system should find `jenkins.war`.  If not, consult the homebrew documentation for the common locations where they place files

07/01/2023, 14:31:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're planning to work with Jenkins in development mode on Windows, you may find it much easier to download the war file and run it from a command prompt window or powershell window with `java -jar jenkins.war`.  The Windows installer is a good choice for people configuring a server that they will regularly use and that they will upgrade weekly or monthly with new releases.  It separates the permissions of the service from the user installing the service.  However, that separation may get in the way of a developer.

07/01/2023, 15:02:19 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Hi all, i just saw on https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/ page how when i scroll down the content on left also scrolls with it and it makes the site hard to surf then i saw in this video last year this was improved under GSOC project. here's the [link of the video](https://youtu.be/fM2SMbppRxw?t=2265 ) so was the changes reverted due to some reason ? as UX will improve with indepedent scrolling
07/01/2023, 15:04:18 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Thanks for reporting it.  That is an unexpected revert.  Are you willing to use `git bisect` to identify the commit that caused the issue?
07/01/2023, 15:07:30 - Kris Stern: <@markewaite-5a15a09bd73408ce4f7fd2a9:gitter.im "Thanks for reporting it.

I cannot see the same behavior for some other pages with more text. 
07/01/2023, 15:08:31 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I see the incorrect behavior on https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/ , a long page that should hold the left side steady while scrolling the right side
07/01/2023, 15:09:14 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): However, I don't see the behavior when viewing a locally built site at commit ee79d7d0e9b99ce26f8d842715b19f6a14112788
07/01/2023, 15:10:16 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I do see the issue with the locally built site at e69cde74dacef596c0cf4da262ad2950d6d1f622

07/01/2023, 15:13:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Vandit1604 thanks very much for detecting the issue.  As far as I can tell, the problem was introduced by f2f7029ba9186bd532a27391b976ff41e503b384, a CSS change that was trying to improve the mobile browsing experience.  If you confirm that is the problem change, would you also be willing to submit a pull request that reverts that commit?

07/01/2023, 15:15:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/#post-installation-setup-wizard is a link that shows the problem in Google Chrome on Windows

07/01/2023, 15:22:13 - Kris Stern: I think we could somehow disable horizontal scrolling for the mobile version while keeping the original behavior for the desktop version. Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh) How confident are you with CSS?
07/01/2023, 15:23:13 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Im pretty confident with css i was just checking it out the bad commit
07/01/2023, 15:23:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, if you know how to do that.  Unfortunately, I do not know how to do that.  I suspect that the addition of the iframe at width 100% is what caused the issue.  That addition of the iframe was required in order to resolve the problem in the pull request that Kevin Martens detected while testing https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5726
07/01/2023, 15:25:30 - Kris Stern: <@vandit1604-63401d426da03739849d8b03:gitter.im "Im pretty confident with css i w..."> Awesome
07/01/2023, 15:25:34 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): i think applying media queries can solve the issue without reverting the commit
07/01/2023, 15:26:34 - Kris Stern: Yeah, that sounds like it might work with media queries
07/01/2023, 15:34:08 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): That would be great, though my past experience with breaking changes to the site has lead me to generally revert the breaking change first, then allow a later commit to redo the reverted improvement in a better way.  If you can find a fix within the next 4-6 hours, then a fix is great.  If it takes more than that, then I'd rather revert first and have a new fix as a second commit later
07/01/2023, 15:38:12 - smilingprogrammer (Oyewale Abdulsobur): Ohh thanks very much @MarkEWaite

However, the output shows that it was published to `https://rajiv.github.io/jenkins.io/master/index.html`, which is incorrect. This may cause an issue in the metadata of the website.
08/01/2023, 05:59:49 - halkeye: iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh): that'll only work if you use http remotes. What's wrong with providing it? Also we deploy a test site every time a PR is created so that script isn't really needed anymore

09/01/2023, 04:15:17 - iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh): Yeah @halkeye:g4v.dev I don't think we need this. As @MarkEWaite mentioned [here](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/5893#pullrequestreview-1239788669) it is better to remove this section https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#deploying-jenkinsio-on-github-pages and update the Makefile accordingly.

14/01/2023, 14:06:41 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @Chinni12102003 that message likely means that you are running git on Windows and you configured git to checkout with Windows style line termination (CR LF) while the plugin has an enforced code formatting convention that files should use the Unix style line termination (LF).  https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings describes it

21/01/2023, 07:23:55 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I think you should try some experiments that use docker-compose to convert the multi-step "Installing Docker"  ( https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/  ) into a single docker-compose file.  There are many small steps to take while making that transition (how to create a network in compose, how to run a service, how to run a second service, how to connect the services, how to ...)

26/01/2023, 11:47:25 - Kris Stern: So which project(s) are you interested in preparing for a GSoC application for? 
26/01/2023, 15:38:46 - Kris Stern: I think if you are keen about a certain project you should definitely work on issues that are related to it, that would allow you to strategically plan for your GSoC application. Also note that you can apply for more than one and no more than three. So do plan accordingly. 
26/01/2023, 15:41:09 - Kris Stern: Another aspect of the application would be your interaction with the Jenkins community at large, like how you ask questions, respond to replies, these all will factor in when we consider each application internally as an org. 
26/01/2023, 15:50:13 - Jagruti: I am unable to decide which project to aim for. 
26/01/2023, 16:16:36 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I am trying to work on the project Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) drift detector . For which I have been learning Jenkins and JCasC in depth inorder to come up with features like Drift detection, Sensitive data handling,Multi-instance support .and Comparison of Jenkins configurations. I also tried to work on issues in JCasC domain , but a lot of them are related to K8s and cloud technologies like AWS/Azure which are topics that I have just started to learn. Please may I know whether it is a compulsion to know them perfectly. I also request the mentors to kindly suggest if there is any other better approach to go ahead with the project.
26/01/2023, 17:04:37 - Kris Stern: No worries Jagruti, I trust you will be able to gradually gain confidence and insights once you work on a codebase long enough, but it will take persistence. 
26/01/2023, 17:12:12 - Kris Stern: <@lakshmishreea122003-63a2fc776da0373984a0cb1c:gitter.im "I am trying to work on the proje..."> I would recommend starting by working on some issues in the issues tracker for the JCasC repo at: https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin. That perhaps is the most direct approach to become familiar with the JCasC plugin. 
26/01/2023, 17:15:03 - Kris Stern: And Jmm  is the potential lead mentor of that project, maybe he will have something to add as to the best approach to prepare for the project idea.

26/01/2023, 19:20:14 - iamrajiv (Rajiv Singh): [Jagruti](https://matrix.to/#/@jagruti1:matrix.org), to make the projects more manageable, try dividing them into smaller, more manageable tasks. Additionally, begin with simpler tasks or test cases to build your understanding of the project before moving on to more complex components. It's important to take your time and don't hesitate to reach out for assistance if needed.

27/01/2023, 19:31:07 - Akarsh-14_gitlab (Akarsh-14): I use windows
27/01/2023, 20:42:01 - Kris Stern: Akarsh-14_gitlab (Akarsh-14): Can you find a file with the path `C:\jenkins\config.xml`?
27/01/2023, 20:43:28 - Kris Stern: Or can you find a file at the path `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\config.xml`?
27/01/2023, 20:47:54 - Kris Stern: I think the default username is `admin`... But not sure about your case
28/01/2023, 06:59:08 - Kris Stern: I think it also depends on whether you installed Jenkins as a WAR file or as an installation, the path will be different for each case
28/01/2023, 08:28:55 - halkeye: <@krisstern:matrix.org "Or can you find a file at the pa..."> Where did that path come from? Something writing to system32 seems really bad. Is that the home directory for a service account?
28/01/2023, 14:19:49 - Kris Stern: That is from some doc halkeye 
28/01/2023, 14:31:47 - Jagruti: Hey, 
29/01/2023, 01:42:47 - Kris Stern: That is supposed to be one of the potential default paths for the config.xml file
29/01/2023, 09:21:04 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): To be more specific , which .java files need to be enhanced so that the plugin processes locally downloaded .hpi files
29/01/2023, 09:57:55 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @MarkEWaite @krisstern:matrix.org i was getting my hands dirty setting up quick test environment for gitlab plugin modernization and found out that 'gitlab/gitlab-ce:14.7.0-ce.0' DOCKER image is only compatible with linux/amd64 and not with arm64 macs. I am thinking of using 'yrzr/gitlab-ce-arm64v8' instead for my mac. Should i modify docker-compose.yml with this image?

29/01/2023, 13:08:51 - Kris Stern: harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): I ended up using my home directory as a root for the new directories to be created in order to run the GitLab plugin on Mac with Docker, with the following paths in my `docker-compose.yml` file:
29/01/2023, 13:09:18 - Kris Stern: Also, I think this would be a good opportunity to open a PR for adding testing instructions for systems based on macOS
29/01/2023, 13:09:58 - Kris Stern: You can either start with an issue and let the maintainers know you will be working on it there, or go directly to open a pull request

29/01/2023, 13:33:19 - Kris Stern sent an image. (Media omitted)
29/01/2023, 13:47:42 - Kris Stern: One thing you can try is to choose `osxfs (Legacy)` instead of the default gRPC FUSE for the file sharing implementation
29/01/2023, 13:49:34 - Kris Stern: I got the containers running, but somehow I don't think everything is working perfectly as I cannot assess my gitlab instance at http://localhost:10080 nor jenkins instance at http://jenkins:8080
29/01/2023, 18:54:12 - Kris Stern: Actually I tried to run the plugin locally as I would do any other plugin using the command `mvn hpi:run`, but I don't think this way is feasible as my Jenkins was terminated due to some issue, though these seem to be warnings.
29/01/2023, 19:02:29 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org i tried modifying the docker-compose just as you mentioned  but for some reason whenever I restart my docker after saving changes, the docker desktop never starts and I need to reinstall it again and again. I spent my 4 hours today just to figure out why this thing is happening with my docker and I am with no solutions 😟 
29/01/2023, 20:29:36 - Kris Stern: That's strange... Have you purged everything that comes with the installation of Docker Desktop? 
29/01/2023, 20:30:49 - Kris Stern: <@krisstern:matrix.org "Actually I tried to run the plug..."> I think I know what I forgot to do now
29/01/2023, 21:07:49 - Kris Stern: harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): How are you currently removing and reinstalling Docker Desktop now?

30/01/2023, 01:37:38 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): @mukundsrinivasb look at PluginManager.java for the `getPluginDownloadUrl` method.  It calls `plugin.getUrl()`.  That seems like a good place to start
30/01/2023, 03:14:35 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): using homebrew 
30/01/2023, 07:28:35 - Ankitvnsbihar (Ankit Tiwari) left the room
30/01/2023, 08:55:25 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Whenever switching to osxfs from grpc Docker goes in Starting forever mode. 🙃
30/01/2023, 09:20:35 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): And as i am not able to switch to osxfs, mounting to my home directory wont work for me. Cant we have a root user inside container. I guess its not the best practice but that's what I can think of 😟. Any other workaround?
30/01/2023, 09:32:19 - Kris Stern: Just wanted to check to make sure if we are on the same page. Did you use these instructions to remove Docker Desktop?: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/uninstall/
30/01/2023, 09:33:36 - Kris Stern: You can try having a root user at the moment to see if it works first
30/01/2023, 10:59:55 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): directly uninstalled through docker desktop
30/01/2023, 11:00:17 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): as mentioned in the doc of docker

30/01/2023, 14:21:53 - Kris Stern: I think it is worth trying to purge Docker Desktop with the command `rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.*` before trying again.
30/01/2023, 14:22:40 - Kris Stern: But I think this path might need to be modified.
30/01/2023, 14:24:01 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): tried this too. still not working 😟

30/01/2023, 14:36:21 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): i already tried all these things. i am not able to use osxfs. i need to find a workaround for it to run without using home directory as its not the best practice using home directory

30/01/2023, 16:13:33 - Harsh3341 (Harsh Gupta): Hello everyone, myself Harsh Gupta. Currently, I'm in my second year of college. I'm new to some Jenkins concepts but familiar with Java and MERN stack, looking forward to knowing more about the Jenkins codebase and getting started with it.
30/01/2023, 16:56:57 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Hello!
30/01/2023, 17:00:24 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): the said repo is cloned and is a git repo, I've checked it
30/01/2023, 17:00:38 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I'm running jenkins through Docker
30/01/2023, 17:01:23 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): can anyone help me out here?
30/01/2023, 17:04:13 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The path you've provided is incorrect.  The path needs to be `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app` 
30/01/2023, 17:06:01 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): @MarkEWaite even changing the path shows the same error
30/01/2023, 17:08:07 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): also, just curious as to why would I be putting `/home` instead of  `/Users/<name>`, as we've to put the path to our locally cloned directory right?
30/01/2023, 17:39:10 - Jiakuang He (Sam): If you use Docker to install Jenkins, you need to make sure the container inside can access to this path.
30/01/2023, 17:41:03 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): When you clone the repository on Windows it must be placed in the location that the tutorial says, `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\simple-java-maven-app` (replace `<your-username>` with your Windows user name.
30/01/2023, 17:41:54 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): With that mapping `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app` is the path to the repository inside the running Jenkins container
30/01/2023, 17:47:49 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Right, @MarkEWaite, understood.
30/01/2023, 17:48:33 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): @jkhe:matrix.org
30/01/2023, 17:53:10 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Use the precise paths as listed in the tutorial for the platform that you're using. I'm a Windows and Linux user and I'm confident that the Windows and Linux instructions work.  I believe that a colleague of mine confirmed the macOS instructions work on his mac.
30/01/2023, 18:00:02 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): afaik I did follow the instructions, but just to be sure let me start from scratch again
30/01/2023, 18:03:47 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I've made the mistake more than once of thinking that I was following the precise instructions, only later to discover that I was not.
30/01/2023, 18:04:23 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes, I'm trying the entire process again
30/01/2023, 18:15:35 - pushker001 (pushker001): I am working on this issue https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/issues/1846 @krisstern:matrix.org has given me guidance to check how other modern plugins handle this type of issue I have done  some research but not getting to fix it, mentors guidance will be helpful thank you

31/01/2023, 12:58:52 - Kris Stern: Hi pushker001 (pushker001) What have you tried previously? If you can share some details then maybe we can make some suggestion as to what you can do next. 
31/01/2023, 13:01:55 - Kris Stern: Next to do is maybe start up the plugin with the command `mvn hpi:run`, then get the plugin to run. 
31/01/2023, 13:02:48 - Kris Stern: Harsh3341_gitlab (Harsh Gupta): Hi Harsh, welcome to the Jenkins community! Feel free to explore and to ask any question related to GSoC and Jenkins. 
31/01/2023, 13:37:24 - mchirag2002 (Chirag Mathur): @krisstern:matrix.org Hey there, I am a 3rd year CSE undergrad and am averse to front-end development technologies and Java. 
31/01/2023, 13:41:54 - Kris Stern: Hi mchirag2002 (Chirag Mathur)! Sure, have you taken a look at the list of 2023 project ideas at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/? It is recommended to have at least a few PR for any Jenkins related repositories, so I would recommend you to pick one(s) that interests you the most. If you are really keen to get your GSoC proposal accepted by us and Google, I think it would be wise to select two projects and submit two separate proposals in the same application in late March. 
31/01/2023, 13:43:12 - Kris Stern: I wouldn't recommend the [Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/) to you because it became clear to us that it will involve a lot of frontend development work. 
31/01/2023, 13:52:27 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): thank you!
31/01/2023, 13:53:45 - mchirag2002 (Chirag Mathur): Thanks, will definitely look into the list. Do let me know if any other front-end ideas come up. 
31/01/2023, 13:58:20 - Kris Stern: Sure! 
31/01/2023, 13:58:46 - Kris Stern: You are welcome! 
31/01/2023, 15:00:44 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): can I take this issue up? https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-70498?workflowName=JNJira+%2B+In-Review&stepId=1
31/01/2023, 15:05:38 - Kris Stern: yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): Please go ahead and work on a PR after indicating on the JIRA issue your intention of following it up. As there is a remark that this issue may be due to a JSONParser bug, the best patch would be some clever workaround if feasible. 
31/01/2023, 15:09:34 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes working on it!
31/01/2023, 15:19:10 - Ulli Hafner: In JENKINS-70498 an example file is already given: when you read this file with the JsonParser then the method getLineRanges should actually return 2 elements.   
31/01/2023, 15:21:10 - Ulli Hafner: For more details we can use the issue tracker...

Please may I know if there is a way to modify what I have done to pass all checks or else I shall do some research about how other more modern plugins would handle this type of error and try to imitate it as advised by @krisstern:matrix.org  .

31/01/2023, 16:28:38 - Kris Stern: Other than that you may also explore the GSoC project idea we have on offer for 2023: https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/
31/01/2023, 16:29:07 - Kris Stern: If you are considering applying this year, be sure to start contributing via code right away. 
31/01/2023, 16:30:13 - Kris Stern: I would say at least a few submitted (but not necessarily merged) pull requests (PR's) would be ideal to prove to us and Google that you have what it takes to complete a GSoC project successfully. 
31/01/2023, 16:32:33 - abhinav700 (abhinav700): My main motive is to gain some real world experience through open source. GSOC would just be a bonus.

31/01/2023, 16:47:31 - Kris Stern: We have `ci.jenkins.io/CheckStyle` as one of the CI/CD checks to check for some predefined rules for styling, and these rules can be very strict. 
31/01/2023, 17:12:27 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org as osxfs is not working for me, I tried to create dockerfile for jenkins and gitlab so as to give the user root permissions  and then run `docker compose`. I am getting this error:
31/01/2023, 17:18:04 - Kris Stern: About the `mvn hpi:run`, have you made sure the global config is set properly?
31/01/2023, 17:20:48 - Kris Stern: Regarding Docker, have you made sure the folders at `/srv/docker/jenkins` and `/srv/docker/gitlab` (I would recommend changing these to something like`~/srv/docker/jenkins` and `~/srv/docker/gitlab\`) and make sure access is granted so that Docker can access these paths.
31/01/2023, 17:22:11 - Kris Stern: Since we are making our own Docker image based on a Dockerfile we have more freedom to choose the paths we want to use. And for macOS I think the HOME directory as the root directory would be more natural.

31/01/2023, 17:56:02 - Kris Stern: But the thing is if we use `/` as root for the `srv` directory it will not work with newer versions of macOS because of the new measures brought with System Integrity Protection (SIP) 
31/01/2023, 17:57:16 - Kris Stern: You can try disabling it temporarily and reenable it after you have done with making the directories, but that seems a bit drastic to me. See: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection
31/01/2023, 17:58:05 - Kris Stern: I think someone else just opened a PR for this exact same issue

31/01/2023, 18:45:23 - Kris Stern: It would be better to indicate on the issue you have started working on it so others will know not to work on the same issue next time

31/01/2023, 19:11:53 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Yes, that's a common result of adding spotbugs checks.  Adding more checks results in spotbugs reporting more items that it thinks could be suspicious.  The tutorial page https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/add-more-spotbugs-checks/#add-a-spotbugs-exclusions-file-if-needed tells you how to add an exclusion if needed.

31/01/2023, 22:39:46 - Ulli Hafner: Good to see. If you just want to fix something in the model then you do not need to setup the whole dev environment. But anyway, good to see that it works now. Typically the next builds are much faster since all artifacts are on your local machine now.

02/02/2023, 12:48:02 - Kris Stern: Hi abhinav700 (abhinav700) I think it also depends of the project idea you would like to prepare a proposal for.

02/02/2023, 17:12:30 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): > > May need to see your DockerFile if you are comfortable in sharing it
02/02/2023, 17:37:50 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org as we are running jenkins and gitlab in an isolated container if we want to use an external postgres db,  we will need to configure the GitLab instance to connect to it by specifying the necessary environment variables, such as the database host, username, password, and port. Otherwise if we want to run a Postgres instance within the same Docker network, we would need to add a service to the docker-compose.yml file similar to the GitLab and Jenkins services and configure it to connect to the GitLab instance. To persist the data, we would also need to mount a volume for the Postgres service. I dont see any one of them implementedn in the code. What am i missing?
02/02/2023, 17:47:14 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): in the error logs of docker-gitlab this line - `execute[create gitlab postgresql user] (postgresql::standalone line 13) had an error` indicates that the command is executed inside the container that has a GitLab instance running and has access to the PostgreSQL database, thus creating a new user in the PostgreSQL database used by that GitLab instance.

02/02/2023, 18:40:45 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): can someone help me out here?
02/02/2023, 18:42:19 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): ```
02/02/2023, 18:43:34 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): so sorry, had tests going on I couldn't give updates earlier
02/02/2023, 19:55:31 - Ulli Hafner: Can you post the error message in plain text as well. Images in threads seem to work not correctly when using Gitter over Matrix. 
02/02/2023, 19:59:20 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): ```
02/02/2023, 19:59:56 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): basically, there are a lot of imports undefined, and `cannot resolve` issues in the entire repo
02/02/2023, 20:01:19 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): For some context: I've setup the entire devenv, and have finally managed to run `jenkins.sh` file successfully, and can see the Warnings Next Generation Plugin Showcase Jenkins dashboard on my `localhost:8080`
02/02/2023, 20:02:09 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I suspect the IntelliJ build for the project is not proper? I haven't work with this IDE before
02/02/2023, 20:04:40 - Ulli Hafner: You need to run maven using the command line first. Then select the folder target/generated-test-sources in IntelliJ (Right Click) and choos Mark As -> Test Sources Folder
02/02/2023, 20:05:09 - Ulli Hafner: Sorry the folder target/generated-test-sources/assertions

02/02/2023, 20:22:18 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): By running maven in CL, you mean running the commands `mvn compile`, `mvn package`in the project root, making a jar file and then executing it, right? please correct me if I'm mistaken
02/02/2023, 21:41:34 - Ulli Hafner: Just `mvn test` and then import this folder.

Functional and Regression testing will be a very important part of the project. If i try solving good first issue then also i will need to test the changes. I should start studying about Advanced Java and testing i guess :)
03/02/2023, 11:06:31 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): I did the above, but that doesn't solve my issue
03/02/2023, 11:12:45 - Ulli Hafner: Which one?
03/02/2023, 11:13:07 - Ulli Hafner: Does mvn verify work for you?
03/02/2023, 11:15:44 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): running it
03/02/2023, 11:16:32 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): > which one?
03/02/2023, 11:16:54 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): also, mvn verify runs well - Build success

03/02/2023, 13:21:17 - Kris Stern: Have you tried granting access to `docker` for the postgres as well?

03/02/2023, 13:43:51 - Kris Stern: What error does IntelliJ throw when you hover over the red pins? Are they the same error?
03/02/2023, 13:45:03 - Kris Stern: I remember there is a way to do it for macOS, let me see whether I can find it

03/02/2023, 14:13:24 - Kris Stern: Would you mind me asking what is the JDK version you are using?

03/02/2023, 14:24:23 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org then why is not working  😭

04/02/2023, 15:04:16 - Kris Stern: I have settled on the following `docker-compose.yml` for my testing for now:
04/02/2023, 15:05:35 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): Hey Kris, sorry for the late reply I have an annoying exam on Monday that's what keeping me busy right now, about the config Ulli suggested I tried it once but it didn't quite work out the way I wanted, I am not able to see what's happening when I run docker-compose up, I'll take a closer look at it after my exam on Monday. Thanks so much for checking in, I really appreciate it!
04/02/2023, 16:02:36 - Kris Stern: GitLab UI not working for `gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest`. Let me try also `gitlab/gitlab-ee:latest` according to the link mentioned previously. 
04/02/2023, 16:09:59 - Kris Stern: Sure! Good luck on your exam
04/02/2023, 16:18:15 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): thanks, kris

04/02/2023, 16:29:05 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): No, plugin health scores can be seen at https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/scores by appending the plugin identifier to the URL.  For example:
04/02/2023, 16:31:03 - Harsh3341 (Harsh Gupta): got it thanks mark 😊
04/02/2023, 16:34:36 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): I believe that you have an error in your plugins.yaml file.  There is no plugin with the identifier `docker`.  There is a plugin with the ID `docker-plugin`
04/02/2023, 16:41:30 - Kris Stern: Just realised Chrome is now blocking port 10080, no wonder why the GitLab UI wasn't working with that previously

04/02/2023, 19:32:14 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org okay so both the containers are working, the gitlab container is not giving error but keeps on running(logs) and when i try opening gitlab on localhost/10080, it gives about:blank.

05/02/2023, 14:38:30 - Kris Stern: For your first question I would say the scope of the project is to rework some existing Docker-based Jenkins quickstart examples to make these more comprehensive and more accessible. And for this goal, we have from the project idea page:
05/02/2023, 14:41:06 - Kris Stern: For your second question, the building Jenkins.io with alternative tools project is to prepare us to replace a tool called Awestruck with a set of new tools like Antora and Gatsby, so in a sense we will e migrating the existing AsciiDoc files to the new codebase.

Afterwards you should start contributing via code. For this please see https://www.jenkins.io/participate/ on how to start.

06/02/2023, 07:10:43 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The container images that are used in the Jenkins tutorials are painfully complex.  The tutorials require a Docker network definition, a Docker in Docker container, and the Jenkins controller.  Then, the tutorial does the undesirable thing of running jobs on the controller, using Docker in Docker to run the jobs.

06/02/2023, 17:26:15 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): When a PR looks like a mess (happens to all of us), the most common pattern is to correct the mess with later commits, push the later commits, and mention in the comments that you would like the PR to be "squash merged".  The "squash merge" will collapse all the mess into a single commit.  The plugin commit history then looks very tidy and the pull request retains the comments and the insights and the education from the journey to the final commit.

07/02/2023, 13:15:28 - Kris Stern: Did you view the site at http://localhost:4242?
07/02/2023, 13:15:40 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org can i use this messed up pr of mine to experiment with git and github things. I didnt think that git will be this confusing
07/02/2023, 13:16:00 - Kris Stern: Or did you try to view the site at http://0.0.0.0:4242?
07/02/2023, 13:16:33 - Kris Stern: No worries, it normally takes a couple tries before you get it right with Git and GitHub
07/02/2023, 13:18:03 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I tried both. In order to check I also tried  curl  http://localhost:4242 this showed up a lot of HTML content but not able to access the site 
07/02/2023, 13:18:09 - Kris Stern: 0.0.0.0 means the browser is listening "on every available network interface"
07/02/2023, 13:19:00 - Kris Stern: Could you tell me what commands you have ran in sequence to spin up an instance of the jenkins.io site?
07/02/2023, 13:21:35 - Kris Stern: Normally I would start by spinning up Docker Desktop (as I use a macOS laptop), then I would run the commands `make` then `make run` and have to wait for a few minutes before the website shows up at localhost:4242
07/02/2023, 13:24:42 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): 1- sudo yum install -y make curl docker  2-sudo systemctl start docker then sudo systemctl enable docker
07/02/2023, 13:28:54 - Kris Stern: I don't think you need to run `make prepare` in step 5 if you will run `make` in step 6. 
07/02/2023, 13:29:24 - Jmm: Just by curiosity and to understand your setup, you are trying to connect from the browser on your laptop into a virtualbox (?) running centos and inside it a docker container with the web server?
07/02/2023, 13:30:43 - Jmm: if this is the case, make sure that the ports are opened and properly "forwarded" at every "enclosure"
07/02/2023, 13:30:50 - Kris Stern: Yeah, your setup could be why the browser could not access the port
07/02/2023, 13:32:08 - Jmm: If my hunch is correct, check whether from within VirtualBox (?) you can connect to the webserver (with curl for instance)
07/02/2023, 13:33:01 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org when i commit the changes i should commit step by step so that commit history is clean and understandable. And when i go to `files changed ` tab and delete a file from there (which is what i did with docker-compose and settings which i accidently pushed with readme file) i actually deleted the original file. i thought i was deleting the files from my pr only and thus only readme file will be left in my pr to merge, which i guess was a wrong thing to do. What i actually want to do is, i want to understand how to contribute to an issue (#1400) by opening a pull request for that issue(but what actually happened is #1403 was opened seperate from the issue which i didnt wanted) and i didnt quite understand how can i delete the original files from the master repo, i am not the project maintainer?
07/02/2023, 13:34:08 - Kris Stern: You can delete a file it the repo via a PR
07/02/2023, 13:35:34 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Message deleted
07/02/2023, 13:36:00 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): I shall try again considering your advice. Since I could not build the site on windows . I learned about VM and tried to build it there. I followed the steps mentioned above.
07/02/2023, 13:36:39 - Kris Stern: I think you are supposed to carry out additional steps like the ones described here: https://www.thegeekdiary.com/how-to-open-a-ports-in-centos-rhel-7/
07/02/2023, 13:40:05 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the suggestions, I will try using curl to see if I can connect to the webserver from within the virtual machine. I will also take a look at the steps described in the article for opening ports in CentOS7 and see if I need to carry out additional steps to access the site. Will try again.
07/02/2023, 13:45:07 - Jmm: Way to go ,lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A) . Wishing you success in your exploration.

07/02/2023, 13:49:23 - Kris Stern: No, just create a new file with the same name docker-compose.yml on the same branch and start from there
07/02/2023, 14:02:31 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thank you, Jmm

07/02/2023, 17:34:46 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): @krisstern:matrix.org can i try draft pr in next pr's?
07/02/2023, 18:12:12 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): CentOS 7 is not a great choice for current development.  It is very old.  It delivers very, very old versions of key programs like `git` and `ssh`.  I believe it also defaults to blocking ports unless they are specifically opened.
07/02/2023, 18:14:32 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The maintainer of the plugin health scoring project is definitely not using a Windows computer.  He may be interested in improvements that help it work better on Windows computers, but that's not the primary focus.  If you are interested in that project, then a Linux machine or running inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is probably a better choice.
07/02/2023, 18:22:40 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the advice. I have windows. Can you please suggest a good way to build the jenkins.io website locally. I am ready to learn if I am unaware of the new build process. I desire to know the most preferred way.
07/02/2023, 18:40:28 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): If you're on Windows, then you could look at the Windows Subsystem for Linux.  I have Ubuntu 22.04 installed on my Windows computer in Windows Subsystem for Linux.  However, I do not develop content for the jenkins.io site in WSL.  I have a Linux computer that I use for that task.
07/02/2023, 19:04:24 - lakshmishreea122003 (Lakshmi Shree A): Thanks for the help. I shall try again considering your recommendation.

08/02/2023, 07:15:14 - Kris Stern: Sure, but for draft PR there would be no reviews since it means that it is a work-in-progress not ready for approval

08/02/2023, 10:00:34 - Ulli Hafner: Yes, you don't need the GITHUB_APP_KEY. This key is required when you want to test GitHub checks (these are reported after a build from the warnings and coverage plugins)

08/02/2023, 18:38:14 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): Yes I have
08/02/2023, 18:44:41 - Kris Stern: Funny, I got `BUILD SUCCESS` after following the instructions... 
08/02/2023, 18:45:51 - Kris Stern: I see you have changed the database name though, but I have just used the recommended name `postgres`
08/02/2023, 18:46:36 - Kris Stern: Maybe tried using `postgres` for the `POSTGRES_DB` instead?
08/02/2023, 18:47:28 - Kris Stern: So this is what I used:
08/02/2023, 19:35:22 - Harsh3341 (Harsh Gupta): same goes for me i have used the same variable in file and got no error

If you are interested maybe you can ask him whether he is still working on it. Since there is no active PR submitted for the issue you can work on it I think. Otherwise it may take a long time for another contributor to come along and pick it up later.

10/02/2023, 17:36:27 - MondalSayantan (Sayantan Mondal): I put in https://plugin-health.jenkins.io and it works just fine although I have to research why the homepage URL is needed
10/02/2023, 17:44:49 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes even I was curious why this was needed
10/02/2023, 17:44:52 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): thanks a lot!

10/02/2023, 17:53:07 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): @MondalSayantan this URL gives an error: `Homepage URL must be a valid URL`
10/02/2023, 18:05:36 - Dheeraj: https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/ worked fine for me too. But I think you can set it to anything. Found this: https://github.com/r-lib/httr/issues/131
10/02/2023, 18:28:09 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): used this: `Use any URL you would like for the homepage URL (http://github.com is fine) and http://localhost:1410 as the callback url`

11/02/2023, 10:27:00 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): > If you are interested we can work on some PRs together, just let me know.
11/02/2023, 13:25:38 - Kris Stern: Sure, do let me know which issue you are interested in working on
11/02/2023, 13:32:02 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Hey People. I am a Newbie , Am I too late for this ?? Want to participate in GSOC 2023 . Can anyone please guide me through how to get started with my first contribution to jeniks :))
11/02/2023, 13:55:46 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/193
11/02/2023, 14:58:58 - Dheeraj: Nice! just checking, are you able to run the project locally? and see the generated scores as well?
11/02/2023, 16:52:26 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes all set
11/02/2023, 16:53:57 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): and I get 0/1887 for all implemented probes on the result page
11/02/2023, 17:16:40 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): will be great if you could lead me as to how to start
11/02/2023, 20:53:39 - Kris Stern: Hi Dneth04 (Nethra) Welcome to the Jenkins community! My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins along side JMM and Alyssa. No, you are not too late to start for this year's edition of GSoC. In fact, the list of accepted and participating orgs will not be released until February 22nd. 
11/02/2023, 20:56:06 - Kris Stern: To begin I would suggest choosing a project planned for 2023 from the list on jenkins.io at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/, then contribute via code as described at https://www.jenkins.io/participate/. 
11/02/2023, 21:56:33 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Hello sir , thanks for the information,I am thinking to choose Building Android apps ,but i am well aware with only java still can i start with it ? 
11/02/2023, 22:00:11 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Can i learn the rest technologies mentioned in the project while contributing?
12/02/2023, 04:13:58 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): Message deleted
12/02/2023, 05:27:51 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Sorry folks! Being inactive as End Semester exams are going on. Will catch up soon but some better contributions. 🤓
12/02/2023, 06:07:45 - Kris Stern: I think the first thing to do is to locate in the repo where to add the new code
12/02/2023, 06:11:38 - Kris Stern: So I would suggest we look in the [src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring directory](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring) to find out where the scores are located and where to put scheduling code for the hourly job to be carried out. 
12/02/2023, 06:55:04 - Kris Stern: Sure, I think that is doable
12/02/2023, 08:01:58 - abhinav700 (abhinav700): Hey folks, sorry i was inactive due to some fever.
12/02/2023, 09:25:22 - daniel-plainview (MUKUND B Srinivas): is [this](https://app.element.io/#/welcome) the one?
12/02/2023, 09:45:18 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): can anyone please look at this, @MarkEWaite, @krisstern:matrix.org, @jmmeessen:matrix.org 
12/02/2023, 11:24:22 - Kris Stern: Yes
12/02/2023, 13:36:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): The project idea page for that idea lists the types of changes to be considered and the skills you'll need to develop.  If those aren't enough, you can also consider the types of improvements mentioned in the "Contributing to Open Source" document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit?usp=sharing and the "Improve a Plugin" tutorial at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/
12/02/2023, 13:47:15 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): yes I would. can you give me time till monday afternoon? got an exam coming up. I'll take this up the first thing tomorrow
12/02/2023, 15:47:37 - Kris Stern: Not a problem yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat) Good luck on your exam!
12/02/2023, 15:51:14 - Dneth04 (Nethra): I have chosen my project as android building but i have started with a good first issue and tried making some changes to the repo,i am finding it little confusing since this is my first project which i am looking into ……
12/02/2023, 15:53:12 - Dneth04 (Nethra): and my question is how to run the changes i tried making  to check whether i have done the changes correct (how to run and check from my personal editor) because the website coding as a whole in repository seems too huge amd its a mixture of all the coding languages like ruby nodejs and etc
12/02/2023, 17:08:59 - abhinav700 (abhinav700): @MarkEWaite Thanks, i will surely check that out
12/02/2023, 17:48:46 - Vandit1604 (Vandit Singh): Hey everyone, I was gathering information about [Exponential backoff and jitter for agent reconnections ](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/agent_reconnections_exponential_backoff/) so i went through the links [AWS Architecture Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/). I checked the issues of [remoting in JIRA](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-70553?filter=-4&jql=project%20%3D%20JENKINS%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20component%20%3D%20remoting%20order%20by%20created%20DESC) but im unable to understand the issues.

13/02/2023, 16:01:48 - Kris Stern: I think you will need to update either https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/test/resources/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/spotbugsXml.xml or https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/test/resources/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/findbugs/spotbugsXml.xml
13/02/2023, 16:03:32 - Kris Stern: Basically you will need to add a pattern to be excluded from the Spotbugs checks
13/02/2023, 16:04:18 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay lemme check this out
13/02/2023, 16:04:22 - Kris Stern: Hi Dneth04 (Nethra) No worries, which project have you been exploring? 
13/02/2023, 16:05:04 - Kris Stern: Okay, cool 
13/02/2023, 16:07:32 - Kris Stern: Though my understanding of it may not be very deep, basically docker-compose is kind of like an improved version of the Dockerfile at least in its usability and behaviour? 
13/02/2023, 16:11:44 - Kris Stern: I think the best way to approach this project is to actually go through the original examples and start to get a sense about how you may simplify things for the user. 
13/02/2023, 16:16:24 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): adding this tag over the code snippet there: `    @SuppressFBWarnings("NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH")` should work? 
13/02/2023, 16:19:13 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): is there a way of running spotBug tests before commiting my changes to the repo?
13/02/2023, 16:24:51 - Kris Stern: I think what they have given in at [L43 of the FindBugsParser.java file](https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/blob/f0e61a727f387a8ed99ad2da30da0c6302d33533/src/main/java/edu/hm/hafner/analysis/parser/findbugs/FindBugsParser.java#L43) is actually the section name `ClassFanOutComplexity`, but not the bug pattern, so your suggestion may not work. 
13/02/2023, 16:26:45 - Kris Stern: But you can try it first to find out for sure
13/02/2023, 16:30:35 - Ulli Hafner: > @SuppressFBWarnings("NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH")
13/02/2023, 16:30:53 - Ulli Hafner: You can run locally with `mvn verify`
13/02/2023, 16:32:21 - Kris Stern: Thanks Ulli Hafner for the correction
13/02/2023, 16:37:33 - yashre-bh (Shreya Bhagat): okay I'll try this out
13/02/2023, 17:57:00 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Can also run locally with `mvn spotbugs:verify`
13/02/2023, 22:09:35 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): thanks for the reply Kris I'll work on it
13/02/2023, 22:44:52 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): Hello everyone, I am working on the Docker-based Jenkins quickstart project and would like to know if there are any mentors who are interested in working on this project (since it affects the selection of the project proposal). berviantoleo (Bervianto Leo Pratama)  and Saeid Bostandoust, as potential mentors for this project, I would be grateful for your assistance with discussions on Gitter.

14/02/2023, 13:52:49 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): There isn't a branch naming convention that is described anywhere that I've seen.  If you'd like some example branch names, see the "Improve a plugin" tutorial at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/

Since the goal of this project is to replace RESTEasy lib with gitlab4j
14/02/2023, 19:15:07 - prince-panwar (prince-panwar): can someone tell me where to learn how gitlab4j library works
14/02/2023, 19:15:30 - prince-panwar (prince-panwar): and also how RESTEasy is implemented in the gitlab plugin
14/02/2023, 19:43:05 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Hi Kris Stern I was exploring building of android app.
14/02/2023, 19:47:23 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): prince-panwar (prince-panwar):  Download the plugin source code, compile it, and familiarize yourself with its operations.  Read the documentation.  Explore the bug reports for the project.  Open the project in a debugger and watch how it performs its operations.
14/02/2023, 19:56:07 - prince-panwar (prince-panwar): I have forked the GitLab plugin repository and I am trying to understand its working

19/02/2023, 12:25:38 - Kunal Singh: Kris Stern:  What do you thing about using NextJS instead of Gatsby for static blog site in jenkins.io
19/02/2023, 12:26:35 - Kunal Singh set a profile picture
19/02/2023, 12:29:47 - Kris Stern: Kunal Singh: Currently we already have a lot of Gatsby tooling in place for the Jenkins infra, that is why we have chosen to use Gatsby. So the choice is based on integration needs more than anything else, and we would not consider using NEXT.js at this stage. 
19/02/2023, 12:30:48 - Kunal Singh: ok
19/02/2023, 20:52:18 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: Sorry for being inactive 🙁 was really busy with exams. I want to work on some good first issues now, thus I am setting up the global configuration of jenkins by connecting webhook url with gitlab. I am getting `Url is blocked: Requests to localhost are not allowed` even after `Checking "Allow requests to the local network from hooks and services"`in gitlab admin settings. I checked that Jenkins and gitlab container are having scope -LOCAL thus on the same local network, but still not working. Do I need to expose my Jenkins url for the webhook integration to work?
20/02/2023, 07:46:42 - Pratik Dey: Hi folks, newbie here who wants to participate in this year's GSOC. I am thinking of choosing Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) drift detector project. Can someone point me on where to look at before I can draft a proposal.
20/02/2023, 11:03:46 - abhinav700 (abhinav700): Hi folks,
20/02/2023, 12:29:14 - Kunal Singh: Kris Stern: all the haml files are being rendered by Awestruct?
20/02/2023, 15:02:01 - Kris Stern: Hi Kunal Singh To the best of my knowledge the yaml and haml files are based on Ruby on Rails, and we do use the language for building the website. To be honest the existence of Awestruck predates my joining the Jenkins project and is no longer maintained, so I cannot confirm with documentation but it is very likely the yaml and haml files are rendered by it. 
20/02/2023, 15:03:24 - Kris Stern: Hi harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh) No worries, but I will need to get back to you tomorrow since I will need to find the time to see if I could reproduce the same effect in my local environment (on a Mac). Will get back to you soon! 
20/02/2023, 15:04:43 - Kris Stern: Hi Pratik Dey Welcome to the Jenkins community! I am one of the three org admins along side JMM and Alyssa. Nice to meet you here. 
20/02/2023, 15:04:55 - Kris Stern: Hi abhinav700 (abhinav700) Welcome to the Jenkins community! I am one of the three org admins along side JMM and Alyssa. Nice to meet you here.
20/02/2023, 15:21:35 - Kunal Singh: so if we are replacing Awestruct with Antora, does everything except docs are going to be build with Gatsby, as antora is only for dosc.
20/02/2023, 15:22:41 - Kris Stern: I think for a start to get an idea about Jenkins and its Plugins-based architecture it would be good to go through the [Modernizing Jenkins Plugins](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvBBnHmZuNQIwIZ86HL39uot6751EOd-f).
20/02/2023, 15:26:07 - Kris Stern: Yup, so we will rebuild the documentation part (User Handbook and Developer Docs plus the rest) with Antora and the Blog with Gatsby with the "Alternate jenkins.io build tool(s)" project, but the first step must be the rebuilding of the User Documentation with versioning before the contributor moves on to the other parts of the project. 
20/02/2023, 15:27:38 - Kunal Singh: what about the jenkins.io home page
20/02/2023, 15:33:32 - Kunal Singh: as Gatsby uses react to render the HTML, so we don't use haml files any more.?
20/02/2023, 15:36:58 - Kris Stern: About the jenkins.io homepage, some of it is [here](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/02cedda5cdc49b376e56abd002134e94332eff7f/content/index.html.haml) while other components are hosted in a separate repo. 
20/02/2023, 15:41:32 - Kris Stern: The blog will be based on AsciiDoc mostly. halkeye (Gavin Mogan) has done some work on it already as a prototype. More info about our discussion can be found [here](https://community.jenkins.io/t/gsoc-2023-project-idea-building-jenkins-io-with-alternative-tools/4863/27)
20/02/2023, 15:42:44 - Kris Stern: So technically this is not a difficult project, but with many parts and much skills to pickup, and a publicly accessible end product to showcase.
20/02/2023, 15:44:54 - Kris Stern: You can see more previous discuss on GitHub as well at https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/issues/5474
20/02/2023, 15:46:29 - Kunal Singh: ok, thanks
20/02/2023, 15:47:10 - Kunal Singh: also, i have update the branch https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/6051
20/02/2023, 15:49:55 - Kris Stern: It would be good for you to get a quick start by becoming a user of the [JCasC Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin) and to poke around based on the information laid out on the project idea's page. Enjoy!

21/02/2023, 07:56:25 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: Isn't #1088 a pretty major issue as a basic functionality of using webhooks to trigger builds is unreliable. How are the users of this plugin even using this plugin with this buggy feature? Is this bug version specific?

And i tried to folk a plugin code from the jenkin's github page and while forking the repository and running it on my gitpod browser i am getting errors !! i have inserted the error page .Can Anyone please help me out to figure this out?
21/02/2023, 19:36:54 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Kris Stern: Can u please help me solve this ?
21/02/2023, 20:44:51 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Dneth04 (Nethra):  you'll need to provide more details about the failure and preferably provide them as text in a GitHub gist or elsewhere.  I guessed that you might be trying to use Java 19, but the tests of that plugin pass with Java 19.  I guessed that you might be using Java 17, but the tests of the schedule build plugin pass with Java 17.  I know they pass with Java 11.  Something else is wrong in that environment and we'll need more info to know what it is
21/02/2023, 20:46:18 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/schedule-build-plugin/job/master/lastBuild/pipeline-graph/ shows that the plugin master branch is passing tests on Java 11 Linux and Java 17 Windows.

22/02/2023, 07:48:03 - Kris Stern: Hi harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh) I meant to make this suggestion earlier, those the hours is limited for the free plan users, have you tried https://www.gitpod.io/?

22/02/2023, 08:49:50 - Kris Stern: Yup, the free plan is currently 50 hours tops. But for open-source organisations we can get more. At least try it first to see if it works first. 
22/02/2023, 08:50:24 - Kris Stern: I will try and reproduce the errors you have encountered later.

22/02/2023, 12:07:43 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: in issue #1088 it states that `We are triggering the Jenkins job from GitLab webhook, the webhook test works fine, but when the job is actually triggered by a GitLab push or note event, it will fail with HTTP 500 error.` When I try testing by pushing even then I am getting HTTP 500 most of the times. only once it happened that webhook gave HTTP 200 but then when I tried to push changes through actual gitlab instance, again got HTTP 500. Is this a bug or I am doing something wrong on my end?
22/02/2023, 12:44:18 - Kris Stern: Don't worry, let me check later tonight for you

22/02/2023, 15:38:04 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Yes sir
22/02/2023, 15:38:37 - Kris Stern: I tried using Gitpod to reproduce your error but I got a Build Success instead
22/02/2023, 15:39:22 - Dneth04 (Nethra): oh But then i am not sure whats causing error in my system

22/02/2023, 15:42:14 - Kris Stern: Or how did you start up the instance? Did you create a workspace on Gitpod first at https://gitpod.io/workspaces?

22/02/2023, 15:47:44 - Kris Stern: Try starting by creating a workspace on Gitpod then choose the suitable editor and setup for the build. I am using Jetbrains Gateway BTW. 
22/02/2023, 15:48:47 - Dneth04 (Nethra): oh ok will try it now

22/02/2023, 16:19:55 - Kris Stern: You don't have to start it up via the client. Once you "spin up" your workspace on Gitpod your client will be automatically started if you choose Jetbrains IntelliJ as the code editor of choice.
22/02/2023, 16:23:35 - Kris Stern: Hi Rohit Naidu Welcome to the Jenkins community! I am one of the org admins for GSoC along side JMM and Alyssa. 
22/02/2023, 16:25:16 - Kris Stern: Hi Aryanshrana (Aryansh Rana) It would be great if you could find an issue in the GitHub issue tracker for the [Jenkins Configuration as Code (a.k.a. JCasC) Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin), which is closely related to the project idea you have chosen. 
22/02/2023, 16:26:03 - Dneth04 (Nethra): oh okay will try that 
22/02/2023, 16:27:29 - Kris Stern: If you would like to work on something related to web development for Jenkins we have the [Building Jenkins.io with alternative tools](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/) project idea, amongst others.

22/02/2023, 17:12:40 - Dneth04 (Nethra): I have got this, but i did not get any info called "BUILD SUCCESSFULL" but i suppose this has no errors. Also, the jet brains account asked for free trail while 'logging in' to get the active license. So, will I not be able to work in this once the free trial ends?
22/02/2023, 17:14:33 - Kris Stern: If you are a student you could get a free JetBrains license https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
22/02/2023, 17:16:02 - Kris Stern: If you run `mvn hpi:run` at the same or different terminal window on the IDE and follow the instructions to click on a button to open the browser, you should be able to go to the Jenkins instance with some additional click to be re-directed to the path `/jenkins`.

22/02/2023, 21:58:12 - Kris Stern: I think even though the reporter of the bug has specified versions for the setup the bug crops up in all platforms, since we have no guard in place against this NullPointerException. I have an idea how to fix it too and it should be quite straightforward.

But these make many assumptions on the knowledge of the user and tends to be complicated, and we would like to have a set of simple and easy-to-follow docker-compose files representing various types of Jenkins instances in the form of examples.

The lead potential mentor for the Screenshot Automation project Mark Waite is currently  away but should be back after a couple of days / next week. He will be the best person to answer any questions you may have for the project if you have them later. 
23/02/2023, 14:25:17 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): hey Kris Stern I was wondering, how is the number of candidates selected for Gsoc decided? 
23/02/2023, 14:26:34 - Kris Stern: This is determined by Google per organisation
23/02/2023, 14:27:23 - Kris Stern: It an vary from year-to-year and is based on a host of factors

Thanks again for the helpful information and I'm excited to be a part of this community!
23/02/2023, 14:29:09 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): So is it already decided, or will be decided after submission of proposals?
23/02/2023, 14:29:37 - Kris Stern: This is sensitive information and we do not have such details from Google 
23/02/2023, 14:30:39 - Kris Stern: It really depends on the strength of the proposals submitted for a particular org. We will not know until the results are announced by Google. 
23/02/2023, 14:31:43 - ash-sxn (Ashutosh Saxena ): Okay, thanks Kris Stern 
23/02/2023, 14:31:49 - Kris Stern: You are welcome
23/02/2023, 14:33:49 - Kris Stern: It is better to post question for the entire channel so that everyone with knowledge can chime in. Also, it would not be very polite for some to be pinged unless there is a very strong reason to. 
23/02/2023, 14:35:23 - Kris Stern: I know it may sound kind of contradictory of what I am saying, but just would like to bring up the importance of etiquette in open-source communications, which may vary slightly from org to org.

23/02/2023, 15:01:37 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): Kris Stern: I have a pretty silly question - how is null-pointer-exception causing http 500 error?
23/02/2023, 15:02:30 - Kris Stern: If you have a NPE you app crashes
23/02/2023, 15:04:35 - Kris Stern: No worries, we understand. Try picking a project idea or two to work on in our [project ideas list](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/). Then work out a strategy for enabling yourself to submit a relevant pull request or two to improve your chances of getting selected. 
23/02/2023, 15:06:29 - Kris Stern: More details may be provided if and when the mentors and org admins decided editing of the project ideas pages are warranted

23/02/2023, 15:21:55 - Kris Stern: Beware, we are talking about a NPE in the Jenkins app but a 500 http error for the GitLab app
23/02/2023, 15:26:06 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Beware, we are talking about a N..."> thanks for clearing it. so when jenkins gives npe, Jenkins should exit? and gitlab app shall give http 500. am I. right?
23/02/2023, 15:26:52 - Kris Stern: Yup, that's the idea
23/02/2023, 15:32:04 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Yup, that's the idea"> thats interesting. when I tried testing the webhook then also jenkins was exiting. so jenkins is giving npe during testing also for me at least(have you tried webhooks ?) in issue #1088, he said `We are triggering the Jenkins job from GitLab webhook, the webhook test works fine, but when the job is actually triggered by a GitLab push or note event, it will fail with HTTP 500 error.`which means wehook testing is working. need to understand this problem well. interesting 🤓
23/02/2023, 15:33:40 - Kris Stern: Yup, actually you can tell from the code level some "guard" against the NPE is missing... I will leave it up to you to work out the patch as a challenge
23/02/2023, 15:34:20 - Kris Stern: You may or may not need to update the Spotbugs settings for the repo as well to pass all the CI checks
23/02/2023, 15:37:53 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Yup, actually you can tell from ..."> I love challenges 🤠

23/02/2023, 16:55:31 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): <@krisstern:matrix.org "Yup, actually you can tell from ..."> so we need to check for any npe in the code and try-catch it instead of identifying which object is causing npe.

25/02/2023, 12:27:19 - Kris Stern: Hi amatuzzehra What steps have to tried but failed to come up with a strategy to approach the JCasC drift detector project idea? To show us to have what it takes to complete a GSoC project on your own it is better to ask questions that are not so open-ended. 
25/02/2023, 12:46:10 - Kris Stern: Hi potter-cmd Have you taken a look and chosen a project from our ideas list at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/?

25/02/2023, 20:22:34 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): btw, sorry for disappointing you. I read on stack overflow that using try-catch exception handling is generally not a good practice thats why asked you in previous issue whether I should use try-catch or not. you said yes if it passes all ci tests. thus I did so. now while solving this issue, I again asked because I thought maybe you could point me towards a better solution. I didnt want to assume things and just push a pr you know. I am a beginner, thus I want to learn, so I am asking questions even if it's the stupidest one. Regarding selection in gsoc, I am contributing because I want to have some real world experience and fill my knowledge gaps. it's very much fine for me if I dont get selected. my purpose of learning is getting fulfilled by contributing to jenkins and I will contribute till I become capable of making some major contributions in java. after that I will switch to some other organisation to contribute in go.
25/02/2023, 23:11:17 - harsh-ps-2003 (Harsh Pratap Singh): its time to sharpen my skills so that I can have what it takes to complete a gsoc project on my own. 🫡

You may try alternative approach to try-catch but it may not work as intended.

26/02/2023, 02:34:31 - Kris Stern: riyasingh1004 (Riya Singh): You can check out the original Docker documentation at https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/, but these are not very user- or beginner-friendly at the moment. So a good way to approach it is to try to have some ideas about how to re-write the examples to make them more user-friendly with `docker-compose`. 
26/02/2023, 03:01:50 - Kris Stern: Hi Muhammed Sabbah Welcome to the Jenkins community! My name is Kris and I am one of the GSoC org admins for Jenkins along with JMM and Alyssa. It's nice to meet you here.

26/02/2023, 17:19:19 - Kris Stern: Thanks, I have just approved this a few minutes ago
26/02/2023, 17:21:26 - Kris Stern: Hi andrew-doghry, welcome to the Jenkins community! My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins along side JMM and Alyssa.  
26/02/2023, 17:22:07 - Kris Stern: Have you chosen a project idea to work on from our list for 2023 at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/?
26/02/2023, 17:23:21 - Kris Stern: Could you introduce yourself a bit for us (the org admins and potential mentors) to get to know you better? 
26/02/2023, 17:32:10 - Kris Stern: My name is Kris and I am one of the org admins alongside JMM and Alyssa BTW.

26/02/2023, 17:37:21 - Kris Stern: For a starter I would recommend you to go through our GSoC guide at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/ and then choose a project idea or two at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/ to focus on. 
26/02/2023, 17:37:55 - Kris Stern: Once you have decided on a project do let us know so we may be able to offer more suggestions regarding how to start.

26/02/2023, 17:47:30 - Kris Stern: Hi Meenal Jain Have you tried submitting PR's for existing issues for the jenkins.io repo or for issues you have opened yourself to fix some bugs found on the site? 
26/02/2023, 17:48:34 - Kris Stern: Before you submit your GSoC application sometime end of March or early to mid April you should have submitted a pull request or two to demonstrate at least your facility with Git and GitHub. 
26/02/2023, 17:49:09 - Kris Stern: Of course, the more pull requests you will have submitted and the higher the quality the better
26/02/2023, 17:49:56 - Kris Stern: Would be good for you to let us know where you are from and a bit of your background as well.

27/02/2023, 14:39:40 - Dneth04 (Nethra): Hi All, I was confused initially which project to go with ,now 1 week ago I started looking into gitlab-plugin-modernization. And this project uses java, docker and GitLab but I am not aware of docker and GitLab. So far I have just done java little in deep, I have understood the project description, but I am not able to figure out or solve issues from GitHub relating to this project. I am not sure how to proceed with it . What step should I take forward so that it can help me understand basic issues under good first issue ?

It's okay even though you're not familiar with some of the things. I would say just try to pick an easy task, probably they have put a tag on GitHub for beginners, and if you get stuck with something, you can always ask the questions in the community. After all, this community is for that very purpose :)

I have experience with tool you mentioned Antora  and DevOps tools such as  Version Control Tool: Git (GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket)
27/02/2023, 22:19:22 - Jmm: Welcome Anshuman Shukla 
27/02/2023, 23:25:22 - MarkEWaite (Mark Waite): Antora is strongly preferred because the Jenkins documentation is written in Asciidoc and Antora is a well-maintained tool that generates web sites from Asciidoc.  Other tools are much less likely to be accepted because after Google Summer of Code completes, we assume that existing maintainers will need to improve and modify the implementation.
28/02/2023, 05:58:21 - Kris Stern: Hi tokaygeckot Did you use your private key or public key for the key configuration?

28/02/2023, 07:59:53 - tokaygeckot: Nope, will give a shot on this too
28/02/2023, 08:00:29 - Kris Stern: Okay, cool

28/02/2023, 08:06:01 - Kris Stern: I read somewhere for dealing with `Temporary failure in name resolution`, it would be worth to try restarting the docker service with something like
28/02/2023, 09:13:44 - Kris Stern: Also tokaygeckot Can you show us how you pass in the public key during the step:
28/02/2023, 09:13:59 - Kris Stern: The syntax may be important
28/02/2023, 09:20:16 - Kris Stern: Or you could mask some parts of your public key with say like an `x` for security reasons but we will need to be able to see the syntax.

28/02/2023, 13:31:21 - i-am-yuvi (Yuvraj Chhetri): Hey Kris Stern I am working on JCasC drift detector idea, I was thinking of getting the current jenkins configuration snapshot using the "ConfigurationSnapshot" class. After that we can parse the jcasc file(yaml) and then check the current & desired configuration states. What do you think?

28/02/2023, 13:46:49 - Kris Stern: Try moving the opening quotation mark like the following:
28/02/2023, 13:47:25 - tokaygeckot: Sure, will try this
28/02/2023, 13:47:31 - Kris Stern: There are spaces in your SSH public key so unless you put the quotation marks in the right places there could be problems
28/02/2023, 13:47:38 - Kris Stern: <@tokaygeckot:gitter.im "Sure, will try this"> Okay 👍️
28/02/2023, 13:48:23 - Kris Stern: Would be good if you could work on some issues to get to know the codebase better and ask more specific questions

28/02/2023, 13:50:04 - Kris Stern: I would suggest working on some documentation-related issues first at https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/issues. Once you are more confident, try to fix some bugs.

28/02/2023, 13:57:50 - Kris Stern: Hi dhruvithakkar210 I would suggested working more on non-documentation issue that are more relevant to the project idea you have chosen to work on to support your GSoC application, as there is roughly less than a month left before the application opens.  
28/02/2023, 14:06:06 - tokaygeckot: Hi Kris Stern , tried both combination "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY= ssh key" and "JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY"="ssh key"

28/02/2023, 14:08:46 - Kris Stern: Wait, I meant something like the following:
28/02/2023, 14:09:45 - Kris Stern: So copying and pasting this does not work for you?:
28/02/2023, 14:12:14 - tokaygeckot: Nope, not working

28/02/2023, 14:20:14 - tokaygeckot: Hi Kris Stern , do we have some SourceGraph type tool(For finding specific class or checking source of message) for Jenkins to search for keywords

28/02/2023, 14:29:11 - Kris Stern: No worries, I think you are still on track
28/02/2023, 14:30:14 - Kris Stern: But do remember to share your proposal with us to proofread it for you as well as to make suggestions, it sometimes take us to review your work so would recommend sharing at least two weeks early. 
28/02/2023, 14:33:59 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Okay Kris Stern 
28/02/2023, 14:34:11 - Subzer0570 (Udit Damare): Like some discussion or announcement

28/02/2023, 14:47:12 - Kris Stern: I think it is the docker:dind (aka Docker In Docker) you needed when you first ran `docker run \ --name jenkins-docker \ --rm \ --detach \ --privileged \ --network jenkins \ --network-alias docker \ --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \ --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \ --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ --publish 2376:2376 \ docker:dind \ --storage-driver overlay2` on docker.
